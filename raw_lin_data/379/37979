mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|3D|nt|dburn:  nobody had an opening bid at the other table - which is a bit odd on a deal that offers play for 4@h|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  but the system has put West on lead, and he has less reason to lead a club than East does|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dburn:  at any rate, Rosenthal now has the lead thanks to a piece of good fortune on board 1 of the set and a very rare lapse in defence on board 5|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Then I don't know where he was..|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|dburn:  and their pair has a chance on this deal also, if they can judge that no points but lots of fit is a slam|pg||
mb|d|an|spades|nt|dburn:  at the other table Fantoni opened a limited but natural 2@c with the South hand, West doubled and Fantoni jumped to 5@c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  Norths hand suddenly became a monster|pg||
nt|dburn:  here, though, North is not concerned with tactics - he is more concerned with slam|pg||

nt|jtmckee: i guess diamond could be overuffed by queen of clubs ( not knowing where it is)|pg||

mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Helness will not pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Now Helness is thinking|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the question is now, will Fredin double 3@S?|pg||
nt|barnets: well helness doe|pg||
nt|barnets: s not think auto|pg||
nt|barnets: to bid|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure it is a penalty double, may be invitational?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fredin has presented a note about Fallenius's bid|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but then he should not double....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Falleniusk didn't indicate anything too Helgemo|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure, but NS may play Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|pelu:  agree - a strange D - many would trakje that D as 3Â½ @s|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  or transfers.... lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  the differens against OT is that Helness knew about the spade fit|pg||
