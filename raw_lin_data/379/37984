mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|game over: but you might go down after a diamond lead (if you decide to play for a club finesse), |pg||
nt|game over: let's say defense leads a diamond, you win and play ! H AK - now what?|pg||
nt|game over: @H AK|pg||
nt|game over: you can try to finesse in clubs and then cash the @c A or play a club to the Ace draw trumps and hope for a lucky spade break|pg||
mb|3D|nt|game over: the latter is a priori more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: spades Jx or xxx is (with no other information) 52%|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|game over: Jx - xxxx or xxx-Jxx that is|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|game over: but the percentages change because East would not have led a club so he probably doesn't have a singleton there (and not a spade singleton as well)|pg||
nt|game over: interesting to see that Smirnov could not have bid 2NT (or even 2@s) over 2@h as forcing which simplifies this somewhat awkward auction|pg||
nt|game over: Smirnov is thinking about possible hand types for North, he does not need much for a slam but the five-level is not safe|pg||
nt|game over: because hearts might break 4-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Multon is upset because the table rattles, so theres discussion of changing things...we will finish this hand first|pg||
nt|game over: and he does not have an easy cue-bid with 4 of a minor available|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|game over: 4@s was intended as a cuebid I think (they don't play kickback 4@s RKCB)|pg||
