nt|lrobb98:  If Steve G's spades were weaker, you would want to be in clubs; but in std this auction, 1 spade by W, can be still with short clubs; many now play that by bidding one spade, W shows somewhat an unbalanced hand...|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: I suspect 1@D shows @H and 1@H by S is like a takeout x|pg||
nt|phil:  1@c - 2+ and usually a weak NT and CAN include hands with a 5 card major|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|phil:  1@d = hearts|pg||

pc|cT|nt|phil:  well, they cant see the stiff club in North, but East did make a takeout double so rates to have something in clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jkdood: True, it's rare the big hand is the dummy in a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|phil:  standard bidding may end up in same contract played from same side|pg||

nt|jkdood: always hard to find the "other" 4-4 major fit in such auctions...|pg||
nt|wstuart: A useful difference from std methods is to use the DBL of 2NT here as a neg DBL for the 4th suit.  It would work well on this hand.|pg||

nt|jkdood: Although looks like 4@H makes NS, the 4@S sac EW looksexpensive with best defense|pg||
nt|phil:  right, their Flannery is normal range or some high bracket too, correct? |pg||

pc|cK|nt|jkdood: The board (27) we just saw EW in 5@D on the nose, other room stopped in 3N, for a couple of imps perhaps|pg||

nt|wstuart: If we get bored we can open up the discussion (yet again) of whether Flannery is a useful convention.  :)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jkdood: An inspired guess in @H could let 6@D home there, now...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Robinson bids 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Flannery   1@H-1@S shows either 5+@S or 4@S willing to play in a Moysian [4-3 fit]|pg||

Feels a bit resulty to me but a more proper analysis is perhaps required...I've had enough of this hand..... @H to the Queen seems enough....Lets move on :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lrobb98:  this hand does have some swing potential....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: some nice sportsmanship as the players congratulate each other on a great match|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|kit: E-W need to go plus to win, and I don't see how that is realistically possible.|pg||
nt|mwigor:  i made the mistake of saying that before the last board of our national seniors teams|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: other table went +400 on NS cards, as some seem to be having problem seeing that|pg||
nt|mwigor:  NS had an accident and lost|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sartaj1:  Another suggestion :  how about H to Q and then H to 8 effectively two finesses ?...|pg||
nt|mwigor:  that feels better than @h to 8 on first round|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  then that loses when H are 3-3, or 4-2 with doubleton 10....not nearly as good....|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sartaj1:  Kib comment " I thought you said to move on from that" :)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lrobb98:  would not be the first time great pairs have reached slam with 2 aces missing, but.......|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sartaj1:  A new note "Big swing needed"...depends on whose side one is on :)|pg||
nt|kit: danger now if South bids 5@C, but I don't think he will.|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  if Marty cuebids 5 clubs then.....|pg||
nt|mwigor:  Fleischer should be concerned about his lack of aces|pg||

nt|lrobb98:  look out below....if we get a 5 club cuebid.....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i know Al Roth's response would be    Where the hell is the 1@H opener?|pg||
nt|wstuart: Interesting.  If they love Flannery so much, shouldn't they use 2@S after 2@D by either hand as an artificial ask and all other bids in the context of a @H raise?|pg||
nt|wstuart: At least after 1@H-2@D;  2@H-2@S should be art|pg||
nt|phil:  3N, or 5@d seem to be OK. 4@h would fail on the @d lead|pg||
