nt|phil_20686:  North must bid 6H|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  6@H now perhaps a fair two-way shot.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6H for sure|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  incredible to bid only 5H at the first attempt imo, when a singleton club and the diamond ace might give you play for grand, perhaps nevan unsure how to make a slam try over 5H, or of the meaning of 4N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6C if you think they are going to 6 spades|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  No scientific way to bid the North hand. You just have to play with the odds. 5@H and then 6@H looks fine. It can't be that much adrift, can it?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but I dont like to give any info at this stage|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Why should East hold a forcing club hand after all three players have bid? Forcing opposite a 1@S overcall means a pretty good hand.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  But why reserve a bid to show a 20-count?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|BroLucius:  More important to contest 50 part-scores on lesser hands perhaps.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  West was reluctant to give a trick to South's @DK and then suffer a torrent of hearts. It was an over-imaginative lead, as I see it.|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  The defense should duck the 9 of hearts, when south plays the H9 from hand|pg||
