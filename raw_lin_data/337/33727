mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Now only five IMPs separate the two teams... fasten your seat belts folks :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kareno: 6@s but not 6@h|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|barnets: when south finds out 5 spades to 2 hons should do it|pg||
nt|barnets: I am sure he can ask|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, he has the mechanism to ask about spades for sure.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: can't see greco's explanation of 2N    meck hasn't asked yet|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|barnets: south needs to support spades before doing rkc|pg||
nt|barnets: agreeing suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think hampson said 2N =5@S, no @H fit  but there was more to it than that|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||
nt|barnets: that looks like an error rKC in hearts not spades per expl|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: greco seems befuddled   then delayed alert of 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: exciting start|pg||
nt|barnets: hampson must want to play in spades facing 5 to KQ surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: 4N card out - but not on bidding tray|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, this hand hangs in the balance|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|kit: Key to play in spades, not heart, here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: And it looks like they flunked the test.|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|nt|barnets: I am surprised in ther club system they could not make a spade asking bid |pg||
nt|kit: I have no idea why Hampson chose hearts on the info he had, but the punishment is huge.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: perhaps hampson wanted to hide the @S fit|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: big swing for Nickell|pg||
nt|barnets: in 6@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Thought most club systems could do that.  |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: katz Nickell using traditional methods|pg||

pc|h8|nt|vugraphzfv: nickell-katz ARE in 6@S|pg||
nt|chip:  Diamond has had 100 imps of slam luck in this match (or perhaps more) going into this board, so Nickell will doubless think they are due for a little luck.|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: better play as well|pg||
nt|barnets: or better bidding|pg||
nt|chip:  16+ is often 15+ in practice|pg||
mb|1C!|an|Precision|mb|2H|nt|kareno: They surely have had at the 7@s level :)|pg||
nt|kit: Now the slam bidding swings to the other side|pg||
mb|d!|nt|runnerup:  no slam makes @h (k) lead|pg||
nt|kit: 6@S is best, but the 4-1 split and heart lead defeats it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: there must be an option "b" to DBL|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S is a great contract all 3-2 splits just unucky|pg||
mb|r!|nt|kit: Meckstroth has more than the double shows, but I guess he was afraid to bid 2NT due to no heart stopper|pg||
nt|kit: He is probably planning on bidding 3@H over expected 2@H|pg||
nt|chip:  usually DBL is 6-7 or Bal GF not willing to bid NT|pg||
nt|kit: And 3NT over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: sounds right chip - i just didn't want to make that official since not in my notes or what i can see being written   [i can read 6-7]|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell might just bid 3NT, thinking no slam opposite 5-7 |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chip:  Odd they play this way. Normal (and I think better) to play 2M is P/C and XX says I want to play my own suit (so bid 2H).|pg||
nt|kareno: Not if there's a second possible meaning|pg||
nt|kit: I agree Chip|pg||
nt|kareno: For sure better, Chip|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|kareno: Like McCabe|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:  2M as P/C is better both as it puts strong hand on lead (sometimes) and doesn't let both hands know overcaller's suit before they have to act.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|kit: Now Rodwell knows Meckstroth has extras, but doens't know much more|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|kit: oh my -- the stiff spade lead, and now it is cold|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: Heart lead would have beaten this.|pg||
pc|h8|mc|12|nt|chip:  oddly on this hand 6D, the bad slam in theory, is the good slam in practice (as tempts S to lead the wrong major).|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|chip:  In third seat, 8-15 might be more accurate (though less so when Vul).|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: hilarious seeing all 4 players violently alerting 1@C and 1@D openers -- since they have exactly same opening bid skeleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kit: Normal 4@H contract, should be comfortable with hearts 2-2|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: i think 3@H = 4-fit, unbal min   else 2@S w/max|pg||
nt|kareno: At some point you'd think they'd agree to stop those particular Alerts|pg||
nt|barnets: even 6@H makes seing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|kit: that doesn't look like a minimum to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Meckstroth probing for a slam, so clearly 3@H not a minimum|pg||
nt|barnets: just need hearts 2-2 and diamond ace come down in 3 normal|pg||
nt|kareno: Who knows how to value @s K|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: when using screens    both players alert bids by both partners|pg||
nt|kit: could also take double ruffing finesse in diamonds -- not sure offhand which is better percentage.|pg||
nt|runnerup:   @h game here passed hand ..so vant have much more|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think double ruffing finesse better.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west has passed once ..|pg||
nt|barnets: Nickell overeached to 3n on 19 so diamond get few imps back|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: meck doing a lot of writing that i just can't see :(|pg||
mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kit: this may be an ask, and singleton spade shown -- just guessing.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzfv: sorry about that -- futile straining to read notes on either side of screen|pg||
nt|kit: well, I think that will get them to slam|pg||
nt|barnets: not agreat slam|pg||
nt|kit: Still, from Rodwell's point of view with Meckstroth a passed hand he pretty much has to have a void|pg||
nt|kit: And then how well will it play opposite a diamond void?|pg||
nt|kareno: And since no preemption, will work out hearts|pg||
nt|kit: huh?|pg||
nt|barnets: well it makes if you play to ruff 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than taking 2 diamond hooks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit: he will get the heaerts right because he has to|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  depends on weak 2 bid style, for instance Meck might have   xxx, xxxxxx,  Axxx,  Ax|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  no void, and a very good slam|pg||
nt|barnets: I think he will get diamond right also|pg||
nt|kit: I mean't void in West hand Joanna|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  too many cards there|pg||
nt|kit: ah|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  west just needs 6 small hearts and minor suit aces|pg||
nt|barnets: when north has Qx or AX diamond he might get that as well as the axx onn both sides|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  3@S was shortness ask|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: they finally vocalized the explanations|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: I think this solves the heart problem -- he isn't leading from Qxx on this auction|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||

nt|barnets: he cant really think he is making 6 can he ?|pg||
nt|kit: he is worried that 5@S is making|pg||
nt|chip:  Hampson is imagining the A of hearts and making 6 I think. Though of course 5S could make if you move a D to E in exchange for a club (so D void and only 2 clubs cash).|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: my bet just wondering if forcing or not|pg||
nt|kareno: I just don't see how it could be construed a forcing pass|pg||
nt|kit: Well, Hampson did double 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: so one would think that he can beat 5@S|pg||
nt|bobholl: being vulnarable vs NV doesn't make your own cards better :)|pg||
nt|kit: Still, I just don't think you give partner this problem|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@D is 500 if he bids it|pg||
nt|chip:  In the semis Greco and Hampson bid on to 5S over 5C when they had AK, AK,  in the majors  and the club ace, and down off the top in 5S, but since on that hand only one major suit trick cashed (10 card and 8 card fits) it was right to bid|pg||
nt|chip:  This is Greco's 10th straight day of bridge here and has played all the boards, so feeling a bit worn down I think.|pg||
nt|barnets: but its not his fault he has the problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: the event began with 2-day round robin, followed by "round of 16" [only 12 teams]|pg||
nt|chip:  Could they play P/DBL inversion where P asks partner to DBL and DBL invites bidding on?|pg||
