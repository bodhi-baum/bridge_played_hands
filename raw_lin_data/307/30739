mb|p|nt|nilsland:  maybe a direkt 3D will also promise 3card support in H?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  1N rebid would show clubs, all because 1D always promise an unbalanced hand in their system|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: nr 13 was 5H by N just made|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it looks like 3N is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  at least when South have the @SJ :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Chick: the spades can be held to 3 losers, plus the @DA, but he would still have to pick up the @HJ too|pg||

nt|nilsland:  his hand is worth much more in 4H|pg||
nt|Chick: S should probably prefer 4@H also, since he has no guarantee of runnable hearts |pg||
nt|nilsland:  Now a small club is called for - to test declarer|pg||
nt|Chick: small club can't really hurt, lose the club finesse, draw trump, take diamond finesse and park losers on diamonds|pg||
