nt|fabsayc: what relationship between the two bilde's we saw on auken team and this bilde?|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: what do you think of easts initial pass?|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: I think there is no relation actually|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: at least not a tight one|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: But Bilde is a nice last name to have nowadays :)|pg||
nt|mike_G: there is no bid that stands out to me, I guess 1NT is an option|pg||
nt|woozle:  East's pass is awkward...if you can't bear 1NT, how about 2C as a token effort toward game|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: for sure 2@D is an underbid|pg||
nt|woozle:  If West could have opened a strong notrump, I prefer that - EW would be in a decent game in two bids|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@S for me over the double|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzea: here she'll have a hard time i think|pg||
nt|mike_G: that West hand doesn't not look like a NT-opening to me, even if it gets the strength across in one bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3NT by west looks unlikely to fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: i agree with you Mikael|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 14-16 for 1NT, so is actually overstrength|pg||
nt|woozle:  Standard methods are really bad at showing 15-17 hands which aren't opened 1NT - you either end up with a marginal reverse or a tough decision about whether to take a third bid to show the strength|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|woozle:  Or, like here, the strength never gets shown|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: i dont think its a marginal reverse :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|mike_G: if you have some decent sign off methods after reverses you are fine bidding 2@H on this hand after 1@C-1@S|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|woozle:  even with decent sign-off methods, you'll be at the three-level when I'm in 1NT|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mike_G: opening 1NT risks missing 4@H when partner has 4 of those, but it could of course turn out better|pg||

nt|woozle:  One thing I won't do is miss 26-point games|pg||
nt|mike_G: I'm thinking hands that aren't strong enough to use that sequence, T9xx of @H and KQx of @C is enough|pg||

pc|dT|nt|mike_G: the @DK is the ninth trick|pg||

nt|woozle:  diamond finesse for ten if declarer can be bothered|pg||
nt|mike_G: so do I|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i don't|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: It seems that @d very well could be the lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: any low level lead direct should have at least a chance to compete for a part score|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: it is true that East can have Diamonds every now and then, but remember: most often she has a "nothing" 10-13 bal|pg||
nt|mike_G: you might get into the auction as well, why can't partner have an opening bid with some support?|pg||
nt|woozle:  It's possible, but the opponents are listening too. I suspect the double is more likely to help the opponents play the hand, or perhaps judge the auction, rightside things if necessary|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe with two small spades and AQJxx of diamonds i double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree Kiernan|pg||
nt|woozle:  The ability to compete in a low-ranking suit isn't much of a drawcard|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: then you should treat double otherwise i think, cause that hand happened in 2012 and wont come again till 2020|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|woozle:  Somebody asked me how come I assume it's the opponents' hand. For one thing, they're bidding and we're not. For another, it's most certainly not our game, which would be the main reason to enter the auction in a minor suit.|pg||
