nt|bjacobs: If North had started with 9-doubleton: we would be in Grosvenor territory: with South giving declarer the chance to make an unmakeable contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So North could have no more than 2|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|nakatad: 2D opening seems to be weak with both majors|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Needless to say, he gave up on his own convention years ago|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, pass will win some imps, but it's a little dangerous|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Does Welland thrive on danger?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT may not be natural, so he has a problem if it isn't|pg||
nt|nakatad: 4 teams, Italy, Sweden, Denmark and China Blue are stillin the unbeaten brackerr|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He could bid the diamond "suit" ... that should gain a plus|pg||

nt|bjacobs: we will find out if it is: if Auken bids 3@C, it's Lebensohl|pg||

mb|1H|an| |nt|Walddk2: 1@H  spades|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|nakatad: maybe East would like to take back his SQ lead if he knew 2NT was not for both minors|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: 1@S can have four in a (sub)minimum balanced hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's increasingly important to discuss with partner how to deal with transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If a little stronger, Roy would bid 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: There are two methods that are popular.  Method 1:  X = hearts, 1@S is takeout|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: Method 2:  X = takeout of spades, 1@S is natural|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: On this deal, East has a double whatever method he plays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 2@S now confirms four in a rotten hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nakatad: East's first double maybe just a take-out of 1S, so he rebid 2H to show his longest suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But probably 1 down|pg||

nt|bjacobs: what about 4@S?|pg||
nt|nakatad: too weak a suit for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: it's interesting ... 4@S certainly shows SOMETHING in diamonds, but could be a much longer suit than this|pg||
