Others cram in the game-try as well. When I suggested that most good players treated it as FG, there was a cry of horror from Henry Bethe (a fellow commentator) the other day. |pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  East not worth a reverse, so he chooses to open 1NT (which has pre-emptive value against the majors).|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  US players use West's first two bids to show 5-4 in spades/hearts. In the UK many players show this with a transfer sequence and consequently free up this sequence to show 5-5.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  A shocker for E/W who have a slam on top.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|BroLucius:  I think West should have bid 4@C. He has already limited his hand.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  I wonder if West might have bid 3@C at his first turn. This would doubtless be taken as a fit-bid, since he was a passed hand.|pg||
mc|9|nt|BroLucius:  6+5+1=12, even here in Chandlers Ford. And over 3@S, I think he should surely have done more than bid just 4@D. |pg||
