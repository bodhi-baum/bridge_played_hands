nt|gracelin: there still some guesswork to do, declarer wants to lose the club trick to East, but later will he run CQ, or C10?|pg||
nt|pelu:  he will take the !Â§h-finess and disc a @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he draws 2-round of trump, go to dummy with HK to play a club to his 10, all will be fine|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|gracelin: but if he loses that to CJ, he has no more entry to finesse for the CK.|pg||

nt|gracelin: I shud not doubt Helness's ability to do it right.|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is somehow licky that West has to follow to the 3rd round of club to allow the D pitch later.|pg||
nt|pelu:  I had exp a @h-finess - but who can argue against Helness :):) - I try|pg||
nt|gracelin: it might be interesting if East ducks his CK, but declarer will probably guess to play East for CK, to proteck his DK|pg||
nt|gracelin: if fact the H lead also gave declarer an option to finesse H10 for a D discard|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jkdood: Making 4@S in the Open room with the @D ace in a bad side, is quite a nice result for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Here South has wrong-sided spades, very delicate situation for Poland. Other room North declared.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|jkdood: So its somewhat good they stopped, at least +140 saves a couple imps versus -100|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  spects tell me: is 1@s F1 for NS?|pg||
nt|jkdood: 1S by South does seem a bit odd.... not sure  what its about|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: 1s is forcing|pg||
nt|jkdood: Thank you, Mr. SUN that makes much sense now|pg||
nt|darek64: 1@s F1 if bid 1@d= mostly 0-6 HCP|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu:  for NS over 1@c D: 1@D = o-6, 1@S = F1|pg||
nt|pelu:  after 1@c D they bid as partner has open 1@c|pg||
nt|jkdood: SO with weak hand and spades they start with 1@D . Thats the kicker. TY|pg||
nt|pelu:  that make sense|pg||
