nt|pjs_ch:  there are only 3 top losers but at the same time only 9 top winners|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: sorry, didn't quite catch all of that, but Brian never got a heart ruff|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  B60|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dburn: 25? I think he actually had 27|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this was 3N in the other room making easily when the @SJ was led round into the AQ at trick one|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pjs_ch:  as long as the range of 1N is not misunderstood this should be the same contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|pjs_ch:  IIRC all 11-13 balanced hands are opened 1@C by this pair, so 1N here should show more|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the defence could make declarer work harder here - South in some partnerships routinely|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 4=2=5=2 hands might not be opened 1@c, and 1NT is consistent with the same hand and @cJ instead of the ace|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  redouble 1@S with an honour, so the EW hands are marked with the @S AQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pjs_ch:  and North might try another suit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  declarer can clearly make the contratc by playing to the @HK, and probably will but|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the position of the @HA is known only by us (and the defence)|pg||

mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  slightly pushy game here but plenty of play in it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  we are playing this before the other room, so no result with which to compare|pg||
nt|dburn: useful intermediates - this has chances, because declarer's clubs allow her to keep control, but the trump break may be hard to judge|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  drawing trumps won't do here - not enough tricks, so it is set up hearts or take ruffs|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  without a heart trick, declarer needs 8 trump tricks and that's possible somedays but not today|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  although the @CK falling early is a bonus, making the @CQ a potential trick|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble with hearts is that there won't be an entry to them, even if they can be established without conceding a ruff|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  so perahps 5 spades in hand, two club ruffs, and @DA and @CAQ might do|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  but that would need @SK doubleton onside as well as @CK falling|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  oh dear - why didn't I just bid 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure you can win all of those tricks - but if you finesse spades and believe that they are 4-1, you could then play on hearts|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|h3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pjs_ch:  clearly 2@D here showed a better hand than a raise to 2@S would, but that's quite a wide spectrum|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|s6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|dburn: because you can establish diamonds that North can't ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: or, I guess you can do this, but you have to read it very well|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this is aiming for 8 trump tricks and will only be frustrated when South is able to (over) ruff the fourth club|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pjs_ch:  here 3@H will have been alerts as showing hearts plus spade support|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it wouldn't make sense for a passed hand to introduce hearts otherwise here|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  same contract as the other room, which went one off after a reasonable try by declarer|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: won't be flat, anyway|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this double might pull back a few imps, even if it does warn declarer |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pjs_ch:  the fact of partner's 2N bid here giving South the sense that declarer has some gaps|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer can make unwarned - but it is not so clear as at the other table that this lead is a doubleton|pg||
nt|dburn: especially after the 1NT opening, since declarer will not suspect 4-1 hearts|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  I'm not certain but it might be that settign up a second diamond winner is the way to make this|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  since the South pips are so bad|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dburn: it's not so much setting one up as having one in the dummy that South will have to give you at some point|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  by taking ruffs in hand declarer can organise tomake 5 spades there, and two ruffs in dummy is 7|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and two aces is 9|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  so being able to cash one diamond (or @CQ) would be 10|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, as it went at the other table declarer could finesse in spades and play a heart - then, North would eventually have to give dummy a diamond trick or keep repeating the ...|pg||
nt|dburn: spade finesse|pg||
nt|dburn: here, declarer can be pretty sure about 4-1 spades, but not about 5-2 diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  good move by Jones on that last board but also a good "choice" by EW to stop in 2S.  Expecting a swing there.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  this might be a 15-17 1N opener, rbut those playing 14-16 are actually likely to downgrade a 4333 shape here too|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|pjs_ch:  here, despite 17 points, South refuses the invitation, since 4333 rarely generates as many tricks as 4432 and 5332 shapes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pjs_ch:  so we play in 2N with 25 hcp and still there are only 6 tricks in sight !|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the key quesiton here is how South will add to the basic 6 top tricks.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  playing the diamond suit in isolation, the best play for 3 tricks is ace and small to the ten|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  which makes on half the 3-3 breaks and allows you to pick up KJxx onside|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  today it loses two tricks and just about dooms the contract|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pjs_ch:  starightforward bidding that can't be failted|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this presents edclarer with an extr trick on hearts but he still needs two more tricks from somewhere|pg||
nt|dburn: this lead allows declarer to establish a heart, so he has a straight guess in diamonds|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  if it was a singleton ace or king offside, declarer would get two heart tricks, so that might be his first hope|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  he plays instead to guarantee at least one trick (he'd get none if lead was from Jx and he didn't cover)|pg||
nt|dburn: he may even duck a spade, playing to bring 3-3 spades into the mix - if they are 4-2, maybe he can throw the hand with the length in to lead a diamond away from the king|pg||
