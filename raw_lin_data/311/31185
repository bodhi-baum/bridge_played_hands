mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|BroLucius:  A straightforward spade game. The diamond loser may go on the hearts if the defenders do not play an early diamond.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  No reason whatsoever to lead a diamond, of course.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|2C|nt|BroLucius:  The other pair for Fast and Furious were second in the pairs, and first last year. Very strong, so this is no doubt a favourite team.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  2@D on 19 points?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: Yes|pg||

mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Incredible. So they gain 12 IMPs for stopping in 2@D.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  After South's 1NT it should have been easy at this table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  The risk of spade ruffs in 5@D was clear.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: He did not look very happy when he saw dummy|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Hard to guess what bidding could result in that score.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: Two more scores to come|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  At the other table Hausler must have opened 2@H, showing a weak two-suiter in the majors. (They play that method)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The heart game is borderline, but makes on this lie.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: Ok, results are in, we restart in about 15 minutes.|pg||

nt|BroLucius: Four teams had a big win. The next two teams are playing at Table 2, including the Dream Team (a local team that usually does well).|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|nt|BroLucius:  South starts with a cue-bid to show that the later raise is based on points. Oh, they have stopped in 3@S.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  It was around 50-50, OK for a NV game.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The score on Board 15 is doubtless incorrect because the displayed bidding was wrong. We can ignore that.|pg||
