nt|japfel:  Short auction. Normal contract. Jane would not travel that distance, so they are probably playing at her home.|pg||
nt|rickrow:  Last year's final started with a grand slam.  Relatively tame start tonight|pg||
pc|h4|nt|joanng:  Vince must be reading those books about not leading 4th from longest and strongest - not the best start here|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
