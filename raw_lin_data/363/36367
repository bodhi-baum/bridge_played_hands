nt|BroLucius:  2@C is sometimes played as artificial to unravel the wide range of the 1NT response nowadays.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The most famous such method is called Gazilli. (No need to message me if it should be 'zz' in the middle).|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Nowadays many would open on the East cards.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  North will probably go straight to 4@S.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  I expect East opened at the other table. Easier then for EW to get to their game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|BroLucius:  Or perhaps North did not go all the way to 4@S, which shuts East out. Although she should at least double.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  North opens light in third seat.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  West goes straight to 3NT, which is a bit bold.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Close to a slam, because of the very good fit.|pg||
