nt|prospero1:  Referring to the fact that it is rarely right to defend 4@h when you have a good spade fit and the values are nearly evenly divided|pg||

mb|p|nt|prospero1:  We'll get our first 2@d opening|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|bobh1: so in this case 4@H wasn't a transfer to 4@S|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Short diamonds, could be 43 either way in majors or diamond void with 44 majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: tempting for S to bid|pg||
nt|prospero1:  On my card it says "4415 missing a card" ... obvoiusly I can't have fourteen cards|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  They have a lot of structure here, but no reason not to just bid 3N|pg||
pc|h3|nt|prospero1:  Not sure what Bathurst/Dwyer agree the double of 2@d is ... we play an opening hand with 5+ diamonds|pg||
nt|prospero1:  This hand would qualify|pg||
nt|bobh1: having no entries, N tries to find his partner's tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just as well S didn't, else he would have been taken out on a stretcher  |pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Yes, David, clubs is the one suit the defenders never want to play in|pg||

nt|bobh1: entries are a little awkward but he should work it out|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|prospero1:  Staying quiet was certainly right for Bathurst on this hand ... even had he escaped, he might have pinpointed the spades|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|prospero1:  One way or another Bathurst will win the next spade trick and lead a heart back to dummy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He knows N is 6 clubs, 1 heart ... 33? or 42? Singleton heart lead I think is not as telling as other auctions because Dwyer knows Bathurst has five hearts|pg||

nt|medwards: He is forced to drop king now|pg||
nt|medwards: Queen|pg||
nt|prospero1:  If S has @dA, then cash club, diamond off, and S will have to play spades for him|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dburn: not forced - he has the option of playing North for @dA and another honour, when he could exit from dummy with a diamond|pg||

nt|dburn: making 3NT on the previous deal did not do Nickell a lot of good - at the other table the opening bid was 1@c, and South bid 2NT to show the red suits|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 9 to Kranyak on  33 - 800 penalty next door|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|prospero1:  1@c 16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|dburn: the opponents showed him somre red cards of their own, and 3@d doubled cost 800|pg||
mb|1N|an|minors|nt|prospero1:  They are likely playing "Meckwell light"|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  1@d negative|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|prospero1:  1N is "Mathe" ... X for majors, 1N for minors, still on after 1@c-1@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  This should be enough to encourage Bathurst to game|pg||
nt|bobh1: so kevin bathurst picked up a swing by passing over their mini-roman 2@D |pg||
nt|bobh1: on 33|pg||
nt|prospero1:  2@d XX would have been 560, so still 6 IMPs|pg||

nt|dburn: perhaps, but he was facing a maximum of a seven count, and he was not vulnerable|pg||
pc|c6|nt|medwards: Is the north hand really a negative?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thin 4@h - diamond ruff would beat it, but it would depend who became declarer|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hand from match QTxxx -- KQxx ATxx 1H-p-p-? 1S or double?|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  They have modified this structure recently, but I expect 2@h says "not a bare minimum"|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Regarding AK A as somewhat better than the bottom of what they open|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|bobh1: people tell me it's just a decent hand|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I think Meckstroth is choosing between a reask, forcing to game with five spades, or inviting in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|prospero1:  Not sure if this is the reask or GF with five spades exactly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 2@S is asking|pg||

nt|prospero1:  If he passes 3@c, it is the reask and Rodwell says just above a bare minimum with no four-card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  OK, so this is the GF with five spades exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  He has another bid over 2@c to show 6+ spades|pg||
nt|bobh1: as we all expect them to, they breeze into 3N with 11 opp 11|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|prospero1:  So, a classic Meckwell 3N, probably down, but NS have to defend correctly|pg||
nt|dburn: this is standard Meckwell - bid 3NT without many points and try to make it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it will make as long as NS are allergic to diamonds|pg||

nt|bobh1: but that's assuming they defend double dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bobh1: pretty incredible lead by N|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So my knowledge of Meckwell is from watching them closely for four years and trying to play their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4H would be beyond the reach of most mortals|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe there was something more to Meckwell's auction than we knew|pg||
nt|prospero1:  My junior partner, Stephen Drodge, did much of the reverse engineering|pg||
pc|c5|nt|prospero1:  I'm pretty confident that 2@h said no four-card major, not a bare minimum, 2@s reask, 3@c was last chance to get out below game ...|pg||

nt|prospero1:  But I don't play the cards as well as Meckstroth|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps i agree|pg||
nt|prospero1:  5 more IMPs to Bathurst on 38 when the Nickell team played 1N at both tables and went down at both|pg||

nt|dburn: may not be so bad now|pg||
nt|bobh1: but as you say when you play the cards like Meckstroth you can be very aggressive in the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess when you bid aggressively you have to accept an occasional, penalty|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Bathurst might have considered a spade lead on the auction|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Unlikely partner has no honor in the suit|pg||
nt|dburn: a club was fine - declarer was looking at the wrong end of 800 if the defenders had shifted to trumps|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Trump now?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: down one if Meckstroth plays low, down the small matter of four if he plays the king|pg||
nt|bobh1: reminiscent of a hand from the last set|pg||
nt|prospero1:  You don't want a successful guess to result in -200 ... you want it to be +600|pg||
nt|bobh1: where mis-guessing to play the K of trumps in a similar situation was very costly to Nickell|pg||
nt|bobh1: Steve Weinstein was the declarer on that hand|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Keep in mind Bathurst opened light ... only 13|pg||
nt|mdgraham: will surely play low - s has shown sAQ hA and N nothing |pg||
nt|dburn: to play the king would be to judge that North had doubled on a six count - I guess he might have, but...|pg||
nt|bobh1: meanwhile another 5 imps to Kranyak on the deal several boards ago where W decided not to trap with QTxxx of @Hs|pg||
nt|bobh1: Kranyak trapped and got to defend 1N instead of trying to make it|pg||
nt|prospero1:  And another six where Dwyer found the diamond lead to beat 3N with no sweat|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Fabled comebacks aside, this is starting to get to a nervous level for Nickell|pg||
nt|dburn: long way to go - 75 boards after this set, but I agree that matters are becoming a touch serious|pg||
nt|medwards: The is 78 boards to go isnt there?|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Kranyak team is playing confidently and well|pg||
nt|prospero1:  The way to beat Meckstroth is to defend well, and generally they are doing quite well|pg||
