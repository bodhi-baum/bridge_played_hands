mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|drorp: interesting match between the leader of the event so far and an Israel team who had a rough start and are looking for a way to climb back up|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|drorp: EW can't make 3NT, they might make 4@H or 5@C, but both contracts are hard to reach and possible beatable with right defense so they will be very happy with the 300 they get|pg||
nt|drorp: very strange if south did go up A@D on the J, might lose an extra trump trick now to promotion|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: I am sry lost the play now, will have a chat with south after the board so i can see the cards he is playing.|pg||
mc|7|nt|drorp: west at the other table faced the same problem and pulled the double to 4@C where he is playing now, so first blood goes to England|pg||

nt|drorp: Erez is agonizing here when it doesn't matter, happened to me once aswell when i doubeled a grand slam with the ace of trumps and my partner took 10-15 mins to lead :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: Was guessing at the same bid in my head..|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Cant bid 4 nt as bw i guess. That would just be invitational.|pg||
nt|drorp: it's sometimes the best practical way just to shoot the contract, if it doesn't make instantly, they might still need to find the lead to beat it, and without giving any ...|pg||
nt|drorp: information it's not going to be so easy for them|pg||
nt|drorp: south could transfer to spades, but then what?|pg||
nt|drorp: i think if A@H and K@D are missing for example, you'd prefer west on the lead|pg||

nt|drorp: Lee is really into his own world here, he didn't make any progress with this bidding so far, exactly same spot as over 3N, except that partner is now also confused|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: question to the 3 guys upstairs also. Is the bidding getting to artificial ? For mee after 3 weeks in Tromsò it looks like many create problems for themselfes with bad results.|pg||
mb|6S|nt|drorp: finally lee bids what he should have done 5 minutes of headache ago, let's hope Eyal doesnt think his bidding meant something and pulls it somewhere (well 6N is still safe)|pg||
