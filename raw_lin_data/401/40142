nt|game over: some of you might remember the Bocchi-Madala board in a Bermuda Bowl match against Netherlands (Final 2011?)|pg||
nt|thetaker: So Ellerbeck has taken 4NT as KC on @Hs|pg||
mb|6H|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: where one player hesitated for a long time and then did not double, partner led his void suit which was single-dummy probably not the best lead, but it beat the contract|pg||

nt|thetaker: Ellerbeck could have redoubled maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphzay: they say no agremens on 5nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|thetaker: Yes, this is the reason why I asked the question about double in advance.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|thetaker: When opps start bidding towards slam and you have a void, you should start thinking about a possible double early on, because the hesitation would lead to information for partner|pg||
nt|thetaker: West sees no reason to lead a @S, because he would just give up natural tricks. He might also not be sure, if partner even has a void and not doubled on 2 aces|pg||
nt|game over: I don't think you can play down to a four-card ending in which West only has spades, so your best approach is to hope for hearts 3-2 I think|pg||
nt|thetaker: This a huge result from the Closed room for Germany.|pg||
nt|game over: if you have five spades in South and one trump left and play the last trump, West can always discard a spade, so you cannot trim him down to just spades|pg||
nt|mgsch:  take A and pl S|pg||
nt|thetaker: This was my first instinct as well, Gerhard.|pg||
nt|thetaker: South knows, that East is void in @S, so he can just start playing @S through him.|pg||
