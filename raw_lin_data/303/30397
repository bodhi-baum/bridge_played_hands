nt|chmitty: Declarer went one off next door : Helness led a @h and defence played 3 rounds, but when in with the @d K Helness did not cash his @h |pg||
nt|chmitty: so declarer thought he could "safely" finess the @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: and the 13th @h now appeared|pg||
nt|zer: small @H is  best from 2 defenders|pg||
nt|granguru:  Our Game does not support web-version viewing yet.  You need to download a terminal software, install it and then watch.|pg||
nt|granguru:  I am told that to see Italy China you enter the site and then right up red button  (was ok then) =download|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: If he bids 5@S, he knows Nunes will bid on with the Q@S, but he's not sure he doesn't want to bid on anyway|pg||
