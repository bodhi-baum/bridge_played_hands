mc|13|nt|petergill: Perhaps East should have done more, or perhaps West should do something more sdescriptive like jump to 3@D over 2@C, Hard to say. |pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|game over: XX = hearts, West passed first to show two-places to play, his 2@c bid now probably shows both minors (my guesses)|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: maybe South's XX = good hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: but iirc they played 1@h earlier to show spades (not sure what to make out ouf North's pass over 1@d XX though)|pg||

mb|d!|nt|petergill: "about that 2/1', I mean|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|petergill: 2@CX is close to making - by setting up the @d side suit|pg||
