Ginnian started well last night, but there is 48 bds left for Rew to continue the comback they began at the end of stanza 2.|pg||
nt|2Smiths:  Rew, a four person team, will have benefittted from a rest, so I'm expect them to show the form that saw them come from behind to win their semi final|pg||
nt|2Smiths:  I'm Scott, I cannot type, but I'd quickly accept the credit for any insight you want to pass onto me privately.|pg||
nt|2Smiths:  the Rugby has been frustrating to watch this morning, but hold your horses, we were due to start at 9.30 so they won't be far away|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: Hi All we are starting now |pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: Both pairs are playing a mini NT so might get exciting |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|2Smiths:  I was told that Laura (North) has the nicname of Tonic... very appropriate.  I had the pleasure of partnering Paul (South) for a tournament all too many years ago now.  He was good then, and has only improved.  This will be good to watch |pg||
mb|p|nt|2Smiths:  how mini is a mini NT Susan?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: Gos and Laura are 10-13 i think but sounds like Fraser and Brad are even weaker|pg||

mb|2D|nt|cascade: Ginnan jumped to a big lead in the first stanza and Rew clawed just a little back in the second|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cascade: so  north south will play 3NT and EW have no suit to develop quickly enough|pg||

pc|h5|nt|cascade: My prediction was accurate and Ginnan gained 5 IMPs on board one|pg||
