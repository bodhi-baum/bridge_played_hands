nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Spectator comments, and suggestions always welcome|pg||
nt|athene: declarer should have a reasonable idea of the distribution, from the bidding|pg||
nt|shengabus:  particularly regarding (single dummy) lines of play|pg||
nt|athene: spades probably 5-2 (north didn't open a weak-two) and south has 5+ hearts and enough diamonds to pass the double|pg||
nt|athene: so he isn't going to have very many clubs :)|pg||
nt|athene: singleton ace is quite likely|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can't stop all @S ruffs|pg||
nt|shengabus:  People indeed telling me that perhaps taking the @d ace (to try to get spade ruffs) or ducking completely (retaining AQJ) might be better|pg||
nt|athene: north would not double 2@D with only @SAQ, you would think|pg||
nt|athene: so if declarer discovers south has the @CA, he will know not to finesse the @HQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||

pc|s4|nt|athene: trump control - we don't need no stinkin' trump control!|pg||

nt|athene: now if he reads the cards he goes @HA, heart ruff, and just plays clubs, and south has to give dummy hearts at some point|pg||

nt|odysseus69: i have a big dislike of 1NT with a small doubleton and a strong major - and even worse nothing in another suit - but 1NT probably widely chosen|pg||

nt|ahollan1: we still dial telephones even when actually pushing buttons -- what will we call 'table feel' when everything done electronically?|pg||
