nt|gracelin: As south could have a 7222 hand. The 3rd round club ruff is not without danger|pg||

nt|paulg:  a fortunate layout for China with the diamonds both in the South hand and clubs dropping, although practically speaking 5@c is not really better after the 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|aardv:  1NT is 13-15, precision style.  They promise at least 2 diamonds when they open 1@D, so this hand is a bit awkward.  2@C is a possible opening, but 1NT is not surprising|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  gold looking to see if E can have a singleton with 1NT?|pg||

nt|gracelin: EW might make 3NT here for a big swing. |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: The S7 in East hand with both S8, S9 in north is the key to make 3NT.|pg||
nt|panja: what if small @S led and @S4 returned?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Yes, spade to A and a low S will put declarer to a guss.  If he plays an honor, 3NT is down.|pg||
nt|sommer:  the red zone and the 6th @C may make Robson raise!|pg||
nt|wojtekkk: not for sure - N should returned @s4 at second trick!|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe 2NT is forcing here according to Kokish.  You either raise to 3NT or retreat to 3C.|pg||
nt|sommer:  he sees @SK will help p's @Sstop so close call|pg||
nt|sommer:  .. 600 in a lucky 3NT is what we all want ;)|pg||
nt|gracelin: but then DK may not be an entry if declarer has to knock out CA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I agree that if he doesn't raise to 3NT, he shud retreat to 3C.  To play 2NT is not a good idea|pg||
