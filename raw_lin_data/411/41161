nt|warrens:  anyway, let's look at this hand.  |pg||
nt|shuster:  although I'm not sold that there is a reason to adjust, there could easily be a committee|pg||
pc|c7|nt|warrens:  -1 if he ruffs this high and draws trumps hoping for 3-3|pg||
nt|warrens:  He can count Weinstein for 5 @H's, 1@C and likely 4@S since Levin didn't give him a @S ruff, so 4351 is most likely|pg||
nt|warrens:  also, if Weinstein has 4 trumps (3541), he's down 2 in all cases|pg||
pc|h8|nt|shuster:  I'm informed the committee process not the same as in ACBL land at this event, only allowing for appeals on matters of process or factual errors, so we can expect the result of 5@C making to be the final result|pg||
