nt|2Smiths:  Welcome to the final of the New Zealand Teams.After 10 matches in the qualifying the Ginnan team led the top 16 into the knockout stages, and have made their way through to the final.  It has not been without a struggle though â winning their s|pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: Hi Scott and Debs |pg||
nt|2Smiths:  semi-final by 4 imps (less than the carryover advantage with which they started it).|pg||
nt|2Smiths:  While the Rew team finished 10th in the qualifying, they are gathering pace as the event goes on.  They won their semi-final against Mace (one of the pre-event favourites) |pg||
nt|vugraphzhe: we are off |pg||
nt|2Smiths:  by an apparently comfortable 27 imps, but that belies the fact they won the last two stanzas by 57 imps to overcome a 30 imp half time deficit.|pg||
nt|2Smiths:  So here we start, 6 stanzas of 12 boards.  2 of them tonight, 4 tomorrow.  Good luck to all.Iâm Scott by the way.  If you spot something funny or clever, let me know and Iâll copy and paste for the credit.|pg||
