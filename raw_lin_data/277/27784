nt|grebrof: not so easy to take 2 ruffs, but one should be obvious now|pg||
nt|mbruun:  Good stop by Schaltz, so they might have won the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|mbruun:  4 Sp is not a bad spot. Knowing the diamonds splitting 6-1 cools it off|pg||
nt|sybarra: seems to me if there is a @D trick it will not go away |pg||
nt|grebrof: X from W rather than 2nt is better when P has the Qx of @ds and the bidding goes (say) pass - 3@c (if 3@c shows some values)|pg||
nt|sybarra: so at least 1 ht ruff should be obvious|pg||
nt|BalleboDK: i'm sure that dorthe downgraded @dKDx - if she had, had it in @C or @h i think she will have 3 @s |pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, as I said - most times the A of @ds is behind her|pg||
