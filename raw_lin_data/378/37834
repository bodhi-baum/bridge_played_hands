nt|roswolf:  yes but south has overegged his moderate hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It's not a bad hand at all, with a bit of shape and 2 aces|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  We're all suffering from looking at all 4 hands.  Good partners have some honours in hearts.  Garvey was a bad partner|pg||
nt|jacksond:  The NS rule is never miss a game if it is on. Going down when it is not on doesnt violate the golden rule|pg||
nt|roswolf:  :)|pg||
nt|jacksond:  They have a simlar rule at the slam level|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  3nt is not absurd here|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  A studied understatement - it seems a very good contract|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|jacksond:  Well I think Garvey/ Carroll will get higher than 3d|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf:  but i am surprised at the contract in the other room|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But not vulnerable - people are less interested ... it's amazing how much difference that makes to people's auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|jacksond:  Based on an application of their golden rule|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  how do you think you should play the diamonds when East has shown 5+ spades (and therefore West 2- spades)?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Mind you, no entry to the South hand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  I was typing already Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf:  heart lead likely|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  in which case, you don't have to guess the diamonds|pg||

nt|jacksond:  These guys are Whales not little people Geoffrey|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf:  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf:  a rather unlucky lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  You should probably finesse the diamonds, in case they are 4-0|pg||
