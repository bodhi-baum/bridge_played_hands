mb|2C!|nt|CopeyJ: Who is also a youngster, probably around 26 although I am guessing a little|pg||
mb|2S|nt|CopeyJ: Jun is 19|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: So here I imagine 2@C is a weak 2 in @D or various strong options, so Pinder may well jump the auction to 4@D and Allfrey will bid 4@S|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: If Pinder passes (which would be odd in my view), Allfrey should be able to bid 3@D as UCB for @S (assuming N has the weak option for his 2@C)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Sorry - I see Robson is west, so it will be he who bids 3@D as a UCB|pg||
mb|3H|nt|CopeyJ: 3@H natural(ish) game try from Allfrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: and Robson may well bid 4@H, or perhaps 4@C as he does have a very good hand now|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: other than that it was natural ish|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: after 2@H fourth suit from north, south has a difficult bid which Forrester solved by bidding 2@S next door|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: He had already denied 3@S, mind you, so was limited to at most two, and stiff Queen is not a bad holding|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  Yes, 3N would not be good|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Peter Crouch suggesting 4@C with the south hand, he does have great cards for slamming although the lack of a second @S is a slight concern|pg||
