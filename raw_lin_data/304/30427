nt|ahollan1: so  42(43)|pg||
nt|dburn:  you might even make it, on this lie of cards|pg||
nt|dburn:  but if you're going to bid six clubs, you first have to bid clubs, and no one did that (at least, not to show clubs)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking for 6@C with hcp total of exactly 28 or 29 when north will be 4432 or 4333 seems like too much of a stretch|pg||

nt|ahollan1: strange to see lead of @CA   normally at 5+ level  pairs revert back to K from AK|pg||
