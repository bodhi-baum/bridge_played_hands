pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, the X of 5@d and the lead will help Rosenberg, he'll figure out the distribution quickly|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looking at all the cards -- seems Woolsey needed to continue @D|pg||

pc|s7|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, the 3 makes a lot more sense, but still not good|pg||
nt|meargent: good? how does that apply to declarer in this contract?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Warren -- i'm biased by seeing all the cards  -- is @C continuation a bit double dummy?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|3for3:  good is that stewart has to follow to 4@Cs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|warrens:  he didn't know Woolsey was 7-5, could have been 7411|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he plays @c's, he can get to 8 tricks, I don't see a 9th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: auction in other room   1@S-2@S-4@S-P-end|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, I would have bid 2@s over 1@s with North|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
