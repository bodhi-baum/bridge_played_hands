mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|patricck: E/W are likely to bid 3NT, but will they make it?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|vugraphzau: maybe|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|patricck: on a @C lead and the 10 winning, declarer will make if he plays on spades, but he is more likely to play on @D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|patricck: the spade break is only a 36% chance, but the Q@D onside is a 50/50 bet|pg||
nt|patricck: the spades are slightly better than 36% because QJ Q10 or 109 doubletons are all good enough as well|pg||
