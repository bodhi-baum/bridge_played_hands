mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: Always a difficult decision|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kit: Which is more likely -- 6-4 or 5-5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Well, why I would bid is the diamond values - I won't mind if south advances the auction|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Keep in mind different structure -- playing Precision there is no game, so North must pick|pg||
nt|kit: Playing standard South may have big hand and another bid over 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wein "Don't look like 4th best" |pg||
nt|kit: So, if you will go to game when South bids again, then you want to be bidding 2@S.  If not, you want to be passing 2@H.|pg||
nt|kareno: You are far more attuned to Precision than I so I'll listen to you - but what would you have done here?|pg||

mb|2N!|an|Max|mb|p|nt|kit: Of course 3NT hasn't made yet|pg||

nt|kit: Diamond taking a while for his opening lead it looks like|pg||

nt|kit: So Diamond did run -- trusting his judgment|pg||
nt|kit: Now, can N-S judge to double with both of them holding 3 spades?  I don't know.|pg||
mb|p!|an|Forcing|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: Levin will surely pass I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Although he does have exactly the wrong strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Surely you think?  <just kidding you>|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: With his strength 3NT figures to make, but they don't figure to murder 2@H|pg||
nt|kit: With a little less, 3NT might not make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kit: With a little more, better chance to murder 2@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, now trump lead not so clear.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|kareno: Club, then diamond.  n/s need to separate their trumps by getting ruffs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kareno: Heart would help declarer.  I think diamond now|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can take 1 diamond and 1 heart -- question is how many spades|pg||
nt|kit: The spade guess will be very critical|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|kareno: n/s have good trump spots and they can't allow west to lead three rounds without getting some use out of them.|pg||
nt|kit: And I don't know that he will have the info to get it right for sure|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kit: So heart to king, cash queen of diamonds, and then the guess.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: South known to have ace of diamonds, North ace of hearts, and North AQ of clubs.  So,?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kareno: That helps the defense in a way|pg||
nt|kit: This is another approach -- not so sure about that, as defense can score a lot of trumps separately |pg||
nt|kareno: The club play|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT made in other room|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: Not so sure about this play -- lets declarer score another small trump.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|kit: South must have one of the spade honors, so jack of spades has to work.|pg||
mc|6|nt|kareno: The lead is switching again|pg||

nt|warrens:  so far the score is 6 boards to 2 boards for Nickell|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|passell: rare you see a team with a 21 imp gain to be behind|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: do they really play negative free bid of 3@H??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sixela: rare youu see a team with a 21 imp gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I don't know - but Hampson alerted the DBL|pg||
nt|warrens:  I see 9 tricks possible here, but it'll take some work|pg||
nt|passell: no they play transfers over 2 spades but neg dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nickell asked if the other room was done and when I said they were on 14, Greco said "if they're in 3NT it will take a long time to play"|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i think scheduled [keyword] restart time is 7 minutes from now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|passell: at least nine tricks here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz: "I should have led the 8" Laughter|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfb: we'll restart shortly after the other table finishes.|pg||
nt|sixela: nice duck by nick, may not accomplsh anything but getting hampson nervous, but nice anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|passell: he may play the 8|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|warrens:  it worked, a good start for the defense|pg||
nt|sixela: and he did|pg||
pc|cA|nt|passell: he needs to start diamond now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|passell: 8 of clubs could be costly also|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|passell: must play a low dia now|pg||
nt|sixela: the 8 of c was an expensive signal|pg||
nt|sixela: now he must return a low d|pg||
nt|warrens:  he'll need to get his 2 @D tricks and squeeze or endplay West for the 9th (unless he picks up all the @C's)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|passell: ralph will be endplayednow|pg||
nt|passell: if he wins dia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson: "so are your spots here still attitude-ish?" Katz "yes"|pg||
nt|passell: he must play a heart to give him a guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  with Q1087 or K1087, Nickell would lead the 10 normally|pg||
nt|passell: Nickell wishes he had the club 8 back|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|warrens:  he will now very soon that West is 6-5|pg||
nt|warrens:  know*|pg||
nt|passell: now it is all over will know Katz 6-5 when he cashes minors|pg||
nt|sixela: now, easy 9 tricks, he may duck a d to confirm the count, but will have no problems|pg||
nt|passell: I have time to go to the Rangers baseball game now be back for 2nd quarter|pg||
nt|sixela: that is probably riht, in case ralph is 6-4, may nee to play for a squeeze to avoid the h guess|pg||
nt|passell: if Ralph were 6-4 he could throw him in with heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson just showed me his hand, so I could figure out I'd mis-seen the club spot earlier, and since he's still thinking I figured I might as well correct it|pg||
nt|shuster:  thank you Jan.  Your work here has been amazing!|pg||
nt|shuster:  I especially appreciate getting the table banter, which adds a great human aspect to the match|pg||
