mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Rodal F: Many would like to open 1@S at 1th hand. Will might by the contract.|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  A reopening double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Rodal F: So EW lost there 3@D?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|coolbeans:  The double lacks good cards and the vulnerability is a kicker, but W should E is sitting with some values based on this auction|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Would have liked that Matt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|coolbeans:  Well, if W doubles, E may very well pass, and that could the end of the match right there|pg||

nt|coolbeans:  Obviously, W is doubling off of E's hand, but he does have some good defensive values|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Could happen but normaly to risky by E to pass the re opening.|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  Yeah, agreed, but it's definitely a consideration. If you abide by the team rule axiom that you don't leave low-level doubled contracts in it IMPs, then EW will be playing 3@D|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|coolbeans:  S took a conservative option as well, but it could be argued that it's a result of believing they we in a 8-card rather than 9-card fit|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|coolbeans:  6@H is hard to play on a @C lead, as some specs pointed out, as it knocks out an entry to dummy|pg||
