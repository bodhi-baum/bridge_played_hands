mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent:  Bit of an interesting situation for West - to defend with not super @c's or to go to @h's|pg||

nt|benjent:  Stokka's overtake and @d switch looks odd at first glance, but he's to (a) make sure partner doesn't switch to anything, and (b) a @d switch is his best chance to create a defensive trick (imagine partner with KJ8 only)|pg||

nt|benjent:  Doesn't really matter, but could West have read the lead? Does declarer's play of the @h10 suggest strongly enough that he doesn't have the J (and that therefore East has it and has led strangely)?|pg||
nt|benjent:  If I were leading a @h, yes the 8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|benjent:  After seeing dummy, I think West would have liked to surreptitiously grab the X card out of his box and get it back into the auction|pg||
