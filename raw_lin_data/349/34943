mb|4C|mb|5D|nt|lady007:  i think it is more usefull to play some sort of lebensohl here, because you can distiguish between competitive and invitational + hands, as well as have a forcing bid. you lose the 2N call as natural, but you will normally survive that|pg||

pc|h9|pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|lady007:  does south have Kx spades and the stiff ace of diamonds left? Then you should keep Ax spades and the stiff king of diamonds in hand|pg||

nt|lady007:  oh sorry, with K stiff of spades and AQ of diamonds the endplay will not work|pg||
nt|lady007:  because south can return the king of spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  so declarer had to cash the ace of spades. Regardless if south has a singleton king or small singleton he would be endplayed to lead away from the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|lady007:  it seems to me that a low spade could never work as the defense always has 4@h, 1@s and 1@d trick. Unless south is sleeping and ducks|pg||
nt|lady007:  ok that was it|pg||
nt|lady007:  thank you all|pg||
