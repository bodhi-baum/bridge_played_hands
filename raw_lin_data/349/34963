nt|TopWizard:  Iaonnis is a guy, very sorry :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: It's ok :) no problem, in English my name is John :)|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  USA2 in need of a big score, but the pride of USA1 won't let them have it without a true battle|pg||
nt|Harlan: yes (N-S)   ZZ-points are A=3, K=2, Q=1|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Hi Peter - our expert and super analyst Peter Lund has joined us :)|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Harlan, do you think they showed controls, or just shape here?|pg||
nt|Harlan: my guess is shape|pg||
nt|pelu:  1@D - 1@H - 1@S - 3NT - would make it harder for E to find the killing @D-lead|pg||

nt|pelu:  http://worldbridge.org/repository/tourn/Istanbul.14/microsite/Results.htm|pg||

mb|4N|nt|Harlan: USA 1 is in 6@C in teh other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Harlan: USA 2|pg||
nt|pelu:  but I have to admit that NS now could be headed for 6@c|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pelu:  a naturel bidding could be 1@c - 1@h - 1@s - 2@D (4. suit) and 3@c from S that would make N interested in slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Harlan: IF N was exploring, S's AQT@c  and K@h  sure look bigger|pg||
