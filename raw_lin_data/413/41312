nt|lokaty: but when he hits and play a @D?:)|pg||
nt|kit: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|serhat: hard to play A@S and a @S when you have definate @D trickI am sure he will play @C|pg||
nt|serhat: hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: The good news is he doesn't need to do it|pg||
nt|granguru:  hi kit|pg||
nt|kit: Buf if declarer has AKJ of clubs, then he would need to play ace and a spade since the diamond would go away.|pg||
nt|bebechira: we have SF in transnationals today..last set FOR SURE we will have at least one match on BBO|pg||
nt|serhat: if partner has @SK it is 100 -1.. if he has @C A ? it might be too late to produce a @D trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Hello Kit, Swedish and Polish fans are enjoying their breakfast, while u must be looking for coffee at every interval |pg||
nt|granguru:  There is also a chance that S has a singleton @HK instead of @SK|pg||
nt|serhat: hello Traian - how is it all going?|pg||
nt|bebechira: actually..last set we have room for both SF TN...VC and SB PO play only 5 sets|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Niklas still planning his defence|pg||
nt|bebechira: all good|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Should have tried @SA before committing everything to a diamond return.|pg||
nt|kit: I guess is is possible that South has stiff heart and declarer has a way to get rid of 2 diamonds.|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: @h 3 could be a trump echo ?|pg||

nt|granguru:  @s finesse is against the odds|pg||
nt|Nigel: Easy if he plays @s ace and ruffs a @S|pg||
nt|mgsch:  on H lead must take ruffing finness|pg||
nt|kit: Big danger is if he leads club to jack and queen|pg||
nt|stigw: If the trump suit is started with a small to the Jack, he will go down for sure, and still it is difficult|pg||

nt|kit: now he is cold -- one spade ruff does it.|pg||
nt|stigw: Small club from hand now will hjelp, and this maybe even better.|pg||
nt|zaXXon: what about @cA (say droping 2 small cards), @sA, @s ruff, both red Aces, @c to king and then spades?|pg||
