nt|marlowepi: 4D is a possibility too, but it would be my 3rd choice (after 2N and 3D), because it tells the opponents we have a heart fit. 2N and 3D leave some mystery about that|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|janhamhurg:  will North compete to level 3?|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2S in a 44 fit looks like making from the N hand, but pushing them to 3S could swing 6 IMPs or so|pg||

mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: yes the main danger in re-competing is that they might belatedly bid a game. That is unlikely though|pg||
