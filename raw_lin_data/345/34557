mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 6@H a decent sacrifice for EW if 6@D is reached|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Sorry I got lost last hand in the card play|pg||
nt|HedyG: npnp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no worried Jordan|pg||
nt|HedyG: we like a good joke :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|HedyG: you play 4@c as asking for shortness?|pg||
nt|HedyG: or as rkc?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jkdood: There are other "asking" methods also some play|pg||
nt|jkdood: Wow, Bathurst strikes gold perhaps!|pg||
nt|HedyG: Jordan, was 4@c alerted?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most frequent agreements are:   some random slam try in support  OR    poorman's/preempt KC  with steps of 01122|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and i know 1 pair that uses steps of 001122   odd   step denies Q  even   step shows Q|pg||
nt|jkdood: For those that have agreements about 4@C, Bathurst maybe  "hopes" they don't have ironclad understandings over interference|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jkdood: So 2 ways to "strike gold" (of course one can get caught on a bad day for a number)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: knowing preemptor won't have 3 or 4 keycards  steps focus on 0/1/2 with/without trump Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and 01122 refer to those steps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where step 1 shows 0 keycards but says nothing about trump Q|pg||
nt|medwards: Key Card asking bids are alertable on the first round.|pg||
nt|HedyG: but if 4@c was keycard N could bid in DOPI over 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure why that would be necessary Mike -- but there are a lot of things about alert/announcement system that baffle me|pg||
nt|jkdood: I would suggest 4@H by Bathurst is an example of the kind of year he is having; great play/ great instincts / great luck|pg||
nt|medwards: Me too, I was penalized at a National in Memphis. They showed me the rule.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after the interference  it is reasonable to focus on control of overcalled suit  rather than DOPI/DEPO variation to just answer keycards|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: in that case  PASS would just say   no @H control|pg||
mb|p|nt|HedyG: so you never get to show your 2 keycards, great|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: Another term for that: "great table presence"|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: i know many players who would have just blasted 6@D after the 3@D opener|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no interference from Kodayam over 1@C suggests that  [at least] 1@D would be artificial|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe 2@D too rich at these colors|pg||
nt|jkdood: On the other hand, non-event may be the closest thing Al has in common with W Buffett!|pg||
nt|pmasson:  or that he was hoping to be on lead against NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: low from worthless doubleton  -- very eastern european|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this is wonderful play problem|pg||
nt|jkdood: There area couple of ways to bring this home, we'll see if Dwyer can find one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump 4-2  or  trump 33 and bad splitting @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or is there a way to protect against both??|pg||
nt|jkdood: We see 3@S went down other room; but my "impossible"  was surely premature.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pmasson:  He may be thinking about what he would do on the next diamond if he pitches|pg||
