nt|jkdood: The admins are trying to get the scoreboard fixed, stay tuned.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Bd 4 was not a swing board|pg||
nt|jkdood: I have reported the tech problems, and if you were shut out of any room you have our apologies|pg||
nt|jkdood: And they did reach 7NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jan Martel confirmed that ALL Spingold sessions now start  Noon/7p.m. PDT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: she promises to update the BBO schedule|pg||
nt|jkdood: The scoreboard is now up to date, ad we see the 7NT hand gained 2 and Bd 4 gained 1 for a new leader, albeit by not much|pg||
nt|jkdood: Now Bd 4 has been corrected;  so its either 2-2 or 3-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches are 4x16 boards|pg||
nt|jkdood: The official score of course is when the players compare and agree|pg||
nt|jkdood: Al do you like this semi-forcing 1NT style?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ACBL does NOT use  bridgemate [or equivalent] in KO events|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Semi-Force is absolutely better than Non-Force or One-Round-Force -- except when the other method is absolutely better|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hear three voices from high above|pg||
nt|jkdood: Glad i asked :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if fuzzy memory serves    Kit Woolsey is adamantly for  Forcing  and  Eric Rodwell is adamantly for Semi-Force|pg||
nt|jkdood: I had a partner who insisted on constructive raises in major by passed hand, and we therefore played 1NT far too often (my opinion)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Rodwell discussed it on bridgewinners.com when he was "In the Well"|pg||
nt|jkdood: Both of those players have had huge success over the years, so something to be said for each method|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if there was data to prove that one of the 3 options was far superior -- we wouldn't continue to see all 3 in use|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure about Rodwell -- need to recheck Woolsey|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other room is catching up; are we on a courtesy break here?|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Ekeblad is smoking (about 3 cigarettes, it seems)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  it is Steve Robinson rather than Kit Woolsey who uses 1N as Forcing|pg||
nt|jkdood: I was also told by a spec that Fisher takes frequent breaks|pg||
nt|jkdood: Welcome David Bird!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back in my playing days  i frequently lost to the washington d.c. team that included both Woolsey & Robinson -- so i often confuse the two :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: The great Ed Manfield was Woolsey's pd back then if I recall|pg||
nt|jkdood: And that Wash DC team won many many events|pg||

nt|ahollan1: historically  set scores entered faster at www.bridgewinners.com than on the acbl page|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm having trouble analyzing this hand WITHOUT peeking at NS layout :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i will bet my own money that  same teams on vugraph for 2nd set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually changes only occur at halftime|pg||
nt|reisig: This will take some time - he "knows" 6-5 shape for S|pg||
nt|jkdood: Other room in some time trouble, still on Bd 12|pg||
nt|jkdood: If we have same teams; that will mean a delayed start for segment 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Maya had mentioned other time issues for Open Room towards the beginning of the set -- perhaps that has adjusted the Clock|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the issue is mostly    since each match playing a unique set of boards, play of Q2 can begin at any time earlier than posted|pg||
nt|jkdood: Graves finally brought home the tough 3N on Bd 12 for a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which means vugraph operator's laptop won't have time to  finish this set AND get updated with new set of boards|pg||
nt|jkdood: On Bd 13, it did go 1@H  1@S 2@C and thats the final contract|pg||
nt|jkdood: (2@S here was the final spot after 3card raise)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: WBF events download hands to operator's table electronically  but  those events also have all matches playing same set of  boards|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jkdood: Do they start playing the same boards here in semi-finals or any other juncture Al?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: acbl rule is    same boards played only when ALL matches on vugraph|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: and not always then|pg||
nt|jkdood: One spec says Round of 8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: historically for  vandergold/spinderbilt  that means  the SemiFinals|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|mc|10|nt|ahollan1: other table on board 14|pg||
nt|jkdood: Last Bd for now; back in a few minutes. Thx Al, Richie, David, great VU OP Maya, specs, ACBL and Jan and team, and of course BBO|pg||
nt|reisig: As I said -- not easy!|pg||
nt|jkdood: Last bD IS 16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect no more than 10-15 minute break before start of Q2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: set scores will start to filter onto  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|jkdood: Strange time for a break; wonder whats happening, 1 bd to go|pg||
nt|jkdood: I guess when u gotta go u gotta go!!|pg||
nt|jkdood: (I stole that line from a spec just now)|pg||
nt|reisig: And gets worse w age :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes, broadcasting the Seniors Open is really tough anymore!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: break with 1 board to play?   or is Director doing that awful bid of having player wait to see if there will be time or  16 gets thrown out?|pg||
nt|reisig: Would be thrown out -- only due to the other table - not here|pg||
nt|jkdood: Theres some issues in other room; I think some thrown out boards is likely Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Richie   but  [i think] last year   TD forced the fast table to wait before giving them last board|pg||
nt|jkdood: (So,was) Last Bd for now; back in a few minutes. Thx Al, Richie, David, great VU OP Maya, specs, ACBL and Jan and team, and of course BBO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i think that is just wrong on so many levels|pg||
nt|jkdood: (Had that stored, so why not re-use it :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Also thanks to Roland and Peter as well...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David Bird was also doing voice commentary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores are starting to pop up at  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other table crashed  so not sure what's going on there  [or with  16]|pg||
nt|reisig:  16 prob being held ..based on time remaining |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've already mentioned my opinion of that TD option -- what are your thoughts Richie?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levine penalty -- just what they needed|pg||
nt|reisig: It's only fair -- really ...just play 15 this set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my problem was when  they made fast table wait  [a significant amount of time]   before a decision was made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in that other case it was  wait and THEN  fast table given  16  and ended up finishing last|pg||
nt|reisig: I agree w you|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if one table that far ahead -- let them play  and maybe just discard the result for board(s) not played in slow room|pg||
nt|reisig: Now - the break will be very short|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  www.bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|reisig: That too - is unfair - to the players that play at "normal" speed|pg||
pg||
