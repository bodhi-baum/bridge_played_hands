mb|3D|nt|barnets: Adam,Kit|pg||
nt|adamw:  Rosenberg and Willenken had a remarkable second set yesterday.|pg||
nt|barnets: yes they certainly had probably one of their best ever sets|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S looks like a super-accept, but on this hand may get them too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Of course North would be bidding 2@S over 2@H anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: along with good @H  it is possible that East also showing @D card with 2@S|pg||
nt|adamw:  EW Can make 3@H, but it will require some good guessing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: Trump lead is safest, and I don't see why Rodwell should lead anything else.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Except that he won't be on lead now.|pg||

nt|adamw:  Even good guessing will not be enough to make 3@S|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|adamw:  Wow.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|adamw:  A chance for Rosenberg.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: this I don't understand at all, unless he thought 3@S was forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: But Meckstroth passed 3@D, so how can that be?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|adamw:  I like the @HK lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|barnets: Seems surprising South raised after North passed 3@D|pg||
nt|adamw:  Might pick off a stiff Q, might mislead declarer as to the honor distribution, unlikely to mislead partner.|pg||
nt|kit: In all fairness, Rodwell knows about his partner's singleton heart, but didn't know about the sixth spade until Meckstroth bid 3@S.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|adamw:  Mechstroth will do well to hold this to 500.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kit: But I don't think the limited hand is supposed to take this sort of position, since partner's 3@S call may have been a competitive stretch -- as it was.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|barnets: dec willbe forced down|pg||
nt|kit: He knows East is 4-4 in the majors, so will be able to play him for Ax of diamonds and get out for down 2.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2 spades then hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: oh wait -- he is going to get tapped.|pg||
nt|barnets: but the @CJ is atrick|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|kit: I don't understand why East didn't cash the last spade before forcing|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|barnets: he thought partner coming under pressure|pg||
nt|barnets: with the discards|pg||
nt|kit: But perhaps it doesn't matter.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|adamw:  I may be slow -- I can't see how it makes a difference how many spades Rosenberg cashes.|pg||
nt|adamw:  He knows he has the DA as an entry to cash them later.|pg||
nt|kit: club finesse doesn't really help declarer|pg||
nt|adamw:  The downside to not cashing would be to let declarer score his small trumps with ruffs in his hand.|pg||
nt|adamw:  On balance not cashing does seem best -- it makes things easier on partner.|pg||
nt|barnets: its a trick|pg||

nt|adamw:  It is not enough for the TD to rule that Pass was a logical alternative, he also must rule that the unauthorized information (the slow tempo) demonstrably suggests bidding over passing.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s5|nt|kit: Adam, that is clear that the slow 4@S call suggests bidding on.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16  [1/2/3nv]   15-17  [3v/4]|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And personally, assuming 4@S weakest action I think passing would be clear.  Just my opinion.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: chris says just alert me when 15 17|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|adamw:  The crux of the matter was the meaning of 4@S. Per the testimony, East and West were on different wavelengths.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|adamw:  East thought it was his weakest action, while West thought it showed minimum values but with extra values.|pg||
nt|adamw:  Their notes did not address this.|pg||
nt|adamw:  Had an agreement been in their notes it would have been an open and shut case, one way or the other.|pg||
nt|adamw:  Private comments tell me that the hesitation should bar partner. That is not the case. It depends ontirely on the meaning of 4@s.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|adamw:  Because the situation was not addressed in the EW system notes the TD and AC had to assume that the agreement was the one East described, the one least favorable to the side that broke tempo.|pg||
nt|pelu:  Roisenberg: 4@s was my weakest bid|pg||
nt|adamw:  One moral is that it is important not just to have agreements, but also to document them.|pg||
nt|barnets: it is hard to imagine that 4@S was the weakest bid with the @CA and @HK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: middle of play is attitude|pg||
nt|adamw:  Here having it in their notes would not only have helped establish the correct ruling, it would more importantly have made it more likely that EW were on the same wavelength at the table.|pg||
nt|kit: It was -- I think rosenberg just made a bad bid.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|c4|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: it occured to me later that those "wasted" values in clubs weren't really wasted - they would prevent the defenders tapping out dummy's high trumps by leading clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did anyone ever clarify what North's DBL of the splinter was asking/telling ??|pg||

nt|adamw:  Playing as teams of four was common in the USA into the 1940s. Then teams started adding a 5th player in case someone got sick or was simly playing badly.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Which gives West quite a problem.  he has a lot of hearts, but is afraid of missing a vul game.|pg||
nt|adamw:  Everyone played the same methods more or less, so it was easy to switch lineups.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher's 2@D was a weak multi|pg||
nt|kit: So East will transfer, and likely get to 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell probably surprised when 2@H was PASSED by north|pg||
nt|kit: At the other table multi was opened, and the 2@H pass or correct call stole the pot.|pg||
nt|adamw:  Regular partnerships became more important as agreements became more complex and systems proliferated, KS and Roth-Stone in the 50s and Italian inspired methods in the 60s.|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: spades invitational or better|pg||

nt|barnets: well dedeuct the percentage for spades 3-3 from 100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: rodwell says you werent interested in 14 or youi would have asked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th set scheduled to begin in about 9 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: and then divide by 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|barnets: and add them to gether|pg||
nt|adamw:  On a heart lead 6@s would go down with spades 6-0 or 5-1, and when they are 4-2 it would need 3-3 @d or the short diamonds in the same hand as the short spades.|pg||
nt|debrose: Divide by 2?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|debrose: There are breaks other than 3-3 or 4-2|pg||
mb|2C|nt|barnets: and you will come to approx 65 percent|pg||
nt|Drewsky: Consensus is that 6@S about 83-84% without a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: using my calculater of course which may be wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: will be a short break and restart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my sliderule less precise|pg||
nt|debrose: And the person with four spades is less likely than half the time to have 3+ diamonds|pg||
nt|adamw:  I do not take issue with Barnet's math, just spelling out the possibilities!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|barnets: tkks adam :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzff: thanks all my commentators|pg||
nt|adamw:  In the bidding the players are seldom in a position to judge the probabilites so finely -- they do the best they can.|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: btw  other room on trick 2 of this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must be union lunchbreak Adam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: operator will also take union break|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzff: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead in other room  @Cx|pg||
nt|adamw:  They'll stop for the day around 3pm in any case.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: next session starts immediately on time schedule i expect give us 15 minutes|pg||
nt|adamw:  A club lead would give declarer some hope, but I see no way to 11 tricks on either lead.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract other room  [sorry debbie]|pg||
nt|adamw:  Sorry, I was ambiguous! The construction at my place will stop fopr the day at 3pm! The bridge will continue...|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe can make this|pg||
nt|Drewsky: if he can arrange to ruff 4 times in his hand.....|pg||
nt|barnets: by setting uo 2 diamnd tricks|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Drewsky: I dont think he the entries to set up a long daimond without losing 2 tricks first, so he must rely on an trump coup ending. I think he can ruff 4 times in his hand and then exit|pg||
