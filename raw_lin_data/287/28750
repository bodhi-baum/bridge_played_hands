pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|barnets: this board will effecively end the match|pg||
nt|robinswr: the problem about lite opening bids is that Declarer knows that west has both red aces|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec has 5 club tricks 2 spades and to red Ks|pg||
nt|barnets: on the bidding|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|CorpLaw:  still requires careful timing to bring in 9 tricks|pg||

nt|CorpLaw:  before cashing clubs and squeezing dummy|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  then use KS eventually to lead diamond to K|pg||
nt|barnets: needs to break spade communication by ducking the @S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  couldn't duck the first spade, since then W could shift to diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|CorpLaw:  and EW could set up 3 diamonds, 1S and AH|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice extra chance in the @H|pg||

nt|barnets: so well played but easier here|pg||
nt|barnets: North misguessed diamonds but while east still held a long spade|pg||
nt|barnets: in closed room|pg||
nt|barnets: so even had East held the @DA he had the cashing trick of the long spade|pg||

nt|kit: Martel should discard 2 diamonds.|pg||
