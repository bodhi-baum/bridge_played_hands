pc|h3|pg||
nt|twcho: but still not enough for declarer to make his contract|pg||

pc|d7|nt|twcho: they did not bid the game|pg||

nt|twcho: now makeable|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|twcho: as East has been stripped out of entry|pg||
nt|aardv:  clever play by declarer, cutting communications in diamonds before the defence knew what was going on|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|twcho: and declarer can play for establishing @c to discard @s|pg||
