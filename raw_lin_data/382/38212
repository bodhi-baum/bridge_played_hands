nt|TopWizard:  Yes, this is evident it seems :)|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Usually W needs count in this situation|pg||
nt|panja: as David Bird is speaking, there could be three meanings to this small @H2 card....|pg||
nt|panja: attitude, count, or suit preference....|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  W may think they could take 3@c tricks if S has @sKing and 3 small @c's|pg||
nt|panja: primary is attitude....|pg||
nt|panja: count and suit preference come into play if attitude is known/not needed|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  I expect w to shift to a @c as only try to beat|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  W can't see any other way of defeating, so at IMPs a @c is probably the choice now|pg||
