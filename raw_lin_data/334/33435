nt|vugraphzar: Hi everyone: Good Morning. We are up now and waiting for our E/W pair. I have a new Toshiba for today so the technical problems should be alleviated. |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  and good morning to you Karen..  |pg||
nt|kareno: Wonderful!!  This is the fifth set of eight for the CNTC championship.|pg||
nt|kareno: And to you Andy :)|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  120 boards to be played today in 4 15 board segments|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  60 boards today |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  this is board 61 |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  a close match so far..a lot of swings|pg||
nt|kareno: This hand will make 5@s from east or 4 by west, but there is always the risk e/w will get too high.|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: OK everyone. We are good to go.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Hi Karen, hi spectators|pg||

nt|dannymiles:  We are in for a great final day of bridge with such a close match|pg||

mb|3C|nt|dannymiles:  Reminder for our spectators, this is segment 5 of 8, 15 boards each so 60 today, 60 yesterday. We'll crown a Canadian champion later tonight|pg||
mb|3S|nt|capt_aa:  club lead will break spade contract if they push to 5-level here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bbt:  South won't go quietly over 2C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbt:  and now E-W have to stop in 4S|pg||

nt|dannymiles:  Hard to play this from the East chair unless he chooses a 2NT opening and gets transferred to @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: East no longer interested in proceeding with his vulnerable club holding.  Good stop!|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kareno: n/s can make 3 spades here.  |pg||
nt|bbt:  South having the master suit and West holding the minors|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  In case you missed last night's finish, McMullin had a 28 IMP lead with 3 boards to play, but large penalties on 2 of the 3 hands went against McM as Gartaganis racked up 35 straight IMPs...Can they maintain that momentum today?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bbt:  East might compete to the four-level if opener persists in spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|capt_aa:  that must have been a heart breaker for Tom and Samantha if they were watching the finish|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: But only 3-3 in minors not too interesting.  |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|capt_aa:  If Tom play's the Rabii's rule here he can make this |pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|kareno: However if Tom's sniffer is as good as Sam's was yesterday he might nail this|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Tom may get the trumps right...He likely cannot pickup @sKxx on his right anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Tom head in both hands and thinking.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Tom Walsh was King of Bridge a few years back..  and ACBL honor to a Junior player given out annually|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  And surely Thurston would have won the @hA if West had a singleton. So West rates to be 1-2-5-5|pg||
nt|bbt:  but he has to play the Ace now, if he gives up a club, West scores the King on a third round of hearts|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Exactly Bill|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  and the opponent's seem..so he may lay down spade Ace set for ruffing heart|pg||
nt|bbt:  can also postpone the decision by advancing a diamond at trick three|pg||
nt|kareno: Can't postpone this one - MUST take spade ace now if he is going to make it.|pg||
nt|bbt:  right|pg||
nt|kareno: West can take the ace of diamonds and continue a heart.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  I need to work on my typing skills..  opponents appeart to be setting for a heart ruff..  so Tom may lay down spade ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dannymiles:  On board 1, Maks/Rock played 4@s from the "correct" side after 2NT opening and transfer to score 1 IMP for the overtrick|pg||

mb|p|nt|bbt:  neither opponent realy has the clearcut  to bid over 2H|pg||

nt|bbt:  West had a bit of shape but was in direct seat, East was 4333|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bbt:  although West is sort of in "balancing" chair as North made an artificial raise and opener signed off in 2H|pg||

nt|kfung: double is a very flexible bid by jeff.....showing values and no clear cut action|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbt:  I think West's double would be either takeout or cards.....not penalty|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Jeff not thrilled to pass 4@h here with such weak hearts in a known 7 card fit and about to get shortened when the defence plays diamonds twice|pg||
nt|bbt:  I'm not sure E-W have a plus now|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a paper-thin game with force coming in the 4 card holding and a successful club guess absolutely needed.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|kareno: Pass of the double would have worked, 4@c also, but 4@h with this balanced hand ...|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||

nt|dannymiles:  Exactly. And she suspects the opponents are in a 4-3 fit. Even if its 5-3, she does best to attempt to shorten declarer's trumps|pg||
nt|kareno: Nystrom and Walsh have kept their opponents off balance for this whole set.  Very impressive.|pg||
