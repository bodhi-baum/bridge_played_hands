mb|d|mb|2N|an|not good hand for clubs|nt|kit: 3NT is the winner here, as is so often the case at IMPs -- but pretty difficult to diagnose.|pg||
nt|kit: If Levin bids 3@D, Weinstein might work it out with AK of clubs.|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  yes especially hard when opp shows 17-19 :)|pg||

nt|barnets: maybe west could x to indicate a void somewhere|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry missed it gab :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: with the cards in a holding and having only one hand to use, it takes Levin a while to put down dummy.  Also hard for me to see the card he plays, but I can see his remaining cards ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: at all times.  He doesn't sort his hand in the holder, fyi..|pg||
nt|meargent: a little akward to play|pg||
nt|kit: This is still tricky for declarer -- if he plays spade to queen, ace of spade, and diamonds, he is worried about defense getting 2 heart tricks before diamonds can be run.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|kit: Of course we know that would work since we are looking at the 3-0 diamond split -- but he doesn't know that.|pg||
