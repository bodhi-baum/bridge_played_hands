mb|4H|nt|bbt:  probably stalls with 4H at both tables here, though|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  I like the 3@s bid by West...leaves North with a tough call. Personally I agree with Karen and may have tried 4@h with chunky hearts and spade ruffs to be taken in dummy|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, he didn't choose the Moysian (4-3) fit - let's see how this goes.|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the 4-1 diamond break is going to sink this contract.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bbt:  just a spade lead will be enough to defeat it|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Smith placed his partner with 1-3 in the majors and therefore 5 diamonds. (yes, he could have been 1-3-4-5 preparing to rebid 2@c over 1@s)|pg||

nt|bbt:  I'm a long-time advocate of the forcing game when you have length in their trump suit|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  It would never occur to me to lead a club with the West hand. Sure, on some days it will work when a spade won't, but the percentage lead must be a spade|pg||

nt|dannymiles:  For the record, Dbl showed 5+ in a minor and a 4 card major. The hearts looked like 4...|pg||

nt|dannymiles:  Excellent question....up to 23, I had it 153-132 for McMullin|pg||
nt|danmathies:  jeff under pressure|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Yes 25 should be 13 to Gart...whatever the case, very close match and should be exciting tomorrow|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  I'm told they played 25 in 5@D down one in the other room so only 3 IMPs to Gart|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: i will try to connect the tables and enter this score later|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  What's wrong with a good old fashioned 3NT? 28 high card points, no fit, 3NT? :)|pg||
nt|creemore:  is this the fratricide squeeze in action?|pg||
nt|bbt:  yes, not even 5D makes on 25 since you can't reach dummy to get pitches on the spades|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  It certainly was :) however if he'd left things alone, he probably gets to defend 4@h down at least 1|pg||
nt|bbt:  but a phantom save, it turns out.  4H is down and only maker is 3NT by North|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  When you preempt with a balanced hand *and* side 4 card major and the opponents start doubling you, there's a sick feeling in your stomach. We've all been there|pg||
nt|kfung:  somehow on board 26, sam made 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: jeff thinking|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  With so much side strength, I might've been tempted to lead a trump from the South seat...but you are right Bill, the hand sits well for EW, likely 1 or 2 down|pg||

pc|d4|nt|dannymiles:  Perhaps the players are getting tired after 7 full days of bridge (5 handed for the McMullin team)...I see nothing wrong with a simple 1@s on the West cards. If you do balance 1NT, then you live with it and don't later try to "catch up"|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|creemore:  Right, so just pass 3@D|pg||
nt|bbt:  right, to bid 1NT and then go back to spades isn't a very consistent approach|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Indeed. Especially at the 3 level. His partner could have had a weak hand with clubs, which is exactly what he had|pg||
nt|mikeh:  the auction suggested partner had long clubs, and some heart length, so he wasn't favourite to have enough spades to warrant the 3 level with all those red honours in front of N|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|dannymiles:  As expected, on 28 4@h had no play in the open room so the 800 point phantom "sacrifice" cost 15 IMPs|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|bbt:  yes, from what I've watched, it's been too limited a sample for me to have much of an opinion|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: thanks to all commentatoors, bbo, etc|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  True Andy....The Fantunes system is very effective on part-score hands where the opponents have to guess whether to enter at the 2-level, and if they do, they are already a level higher than normal. |pg||
mc|10|nt|creemore:  Nice little comeback for Team Gart, see you tomorrow!|pg||
nt|bbt:  3H contract at the other table....not sure if they were pushed there|pg||
