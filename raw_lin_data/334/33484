nt|shuster:  I have a preference for that treatment, since a double of a splinter is seldom useful as a lead direct, but a lead directing double of a non-splinter suit could spell disaster.|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|pef: Joanna will probably make an unbalanced slam try now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: 3 of the other major is the usual way to do so|pg||
nt|pef: Eugene has only 14, but it's a really slammish 14, so I bet he asks about the shortness|pg||
nt|jkdood: Today the stiff @DQ has good weight; it may get lost in the auction though|pg||
nt|pef: especially down 63|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jkdood: We can see both clubs get pitched; in fact, the whole @D suit behaves like butter|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: No alert to 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: i just hope if they get to slam Eugene leads the K of spades first|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|pef: they play LMH here, so 4c is shortness in diamonds, 3S asked|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|shuster:  An excellent slam; a decent grand - and the other table is in 4NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|shuster:  Here, East knows how huge his diamond support is - and that there is a source of tricks|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  Now thinking to the play, East may be concerned that a club lead will knock out his late entry to the long spades early. If East can coax a spade cuebid out of West, He will be reassured... and might even think it is a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|shuster:  If West held the same hand without the @HQ, you can see that you'd like to be in SEVEN, whereas with the @HQ, SIX might be the better spot|pg||

nt|pef: this is actually the closest of all the matches still being played|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 4@s tenuous at best, though, nothing breaking and not enough trumps?|pg||
