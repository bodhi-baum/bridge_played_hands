nt|chorush: Hello everyone, and welcome to one of the four matches that are less than 10 imps apart|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and 1 match already conceded    Fleisher advanced to R8|pg||
nt|chorush: True, except for that match anybody could win the others|pg||

nt|medwards: Heavy three hearts. Is that system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: halftime scores posted at  http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry  2 sets of 16 to play  even for Nickell Hollman|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Tez: hi all..if you dont see hands..go to lobby and back here|pg||
nt|chorush: Basic EW system is that 1C is used for almost all balanced hands out of notrump range (14-16). Other one level bids are almost always unbalanced|pg||

nt|jjwang:  They are the youngest pair among 6 chinese women pairs coming to dallas|pg||

nt|jkdood: Maybe West should play @DK there?|pg||
nt|jkdood: East should  underlead here, its sort of obvious (in @D)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Against 4 it would be mandatory|pg||
nt|jjwang:  that's why thinking I guess|pg||
nt|jjwang:  try SA first|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i thought rule for NT was that Welland never upgrades, often downgrades  and Auken does the reverse|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: 2NT seems possible with North's hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chorush: Not from my observations Al, although maybe they play differently when playing for real|pg||

mc|7|nt|andyv:  but they got a plus on the board so can't argue with the results|pg||

nt|jkdood: I am surprised BOTH tables bid 1@S-2@H (not 2@S)|pg||
nt|jkdood: EW might escape for -300|pg||
nt|jjwang:  I am even more surprised that NS sold 2S at the other table|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes, other table N gave in to 2@S, here they wouldn't let 4@S go|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some of these pairs play Ghestem or such, not Michaels, so 1S-2@S cue shows clubs with hearts|pg||

nt|chorush: It is possible that NS had no agreement whether, over 2C, 2NT showed a strong balanced hand or the minors|pg||
nt|chorush: Presumably, you should also hav a way of making a takeout double of spades. It is as if the auction had gone 1S-P-1NT to you and you hold North;s hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Jan helped me get the correct format :(|pg||
nt|chorush: Since with a strong balanced hand you would tend to pass 1S-P-1NT, I think best treatment would be 2NT is minors and dbl is takeout of spades|pg||

nt|chorush: Auken has sort of normal 3 spade bid but Roy will not expect that much|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chorush: so she opens 4:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i guessed 4@S :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: No blue card for Roy|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: EW use 3N opener to show opening 4@H/@S that wants partner to declare|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is the only limiting factor|pg||
nt|chorush: 4 spades looks like it is going to make|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what approach for North after limited 1@H opener??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: oh   opening PASS|pg||

nt|ahollan1: any other color where she opens  ONLY 4@D??|pg||

nt|chorush: Actually, it might seem that way but I have seen her bid 5 clubs on hands like last hand more often than 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make that overcalls rather than opens|pg||
