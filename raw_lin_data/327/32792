nt|thenapster: hi again Milan|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: sorry for missing first boards, I was teaching volleyball chinese bridge players|pg||
nt|game over: East's pass over 2@d is forcing, a good rule is two play passes up to including 2@h as forcing (2@s or 2@d are possible as well, just agree with your partner)|pg||

nt|game over: East will probably try to squeeze North (if he holds @d AQ10 and @c KQ), better than to sneak a diamond through (North is very likely to hold the @d A)|pg||
nt|game over: Note that North sits behind the @d K and the @c AJ, so you cannot use the @d K as a squeeze card only the @d 9|pg||

nt|game over: RKCB on hearts and then 6@c is probably not an option because 6@c can be misinterpreted as a grand slam try|pg||
