nt|uni_cicam: 5@C is very close, but there are not many entries to East hand to ruff 2 @H and come back to cash trumps|pg||
nt|ady: problem is if south getrs the lead before trumps are drawn  sspade switch even beats 4 clubs|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: the best play is to play spade immediately so can establish the 11 trick if you guess right - but not working here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzex: not many fast losers, but with @H@H you probably will get short, and lose 4@S and 1@H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzex: now defense might settle for 2@S, 1@H and a @D ruff|pg||
