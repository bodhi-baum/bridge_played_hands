nt|Vugraphzfd: he had looked at it earlier :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: his only chance left = K 3'd of @D in S|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, on the 3NT hand he ducked the lead i guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 12   NIckell over Mahaffey by 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm about to take a losing finesse -- please wait|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: once again reading the sheet with the leads|pg||
nt|jallerton:  He has to decide what to play for|pg||
nt|jallerton:  he doesn't know whatever he does is losing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember slawinski lead   low = even without honor   or odd  with      4 then 3 implies .....   i'm not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: hehe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming  honest lead vs slam|pg||
nt|jallerton:  If he believes the lead, he should play the Q, playing for K43|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think K43 leads 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: odd with honor|pg||
nt|jallerton:  OK, if lead is consistent with K1043 then should play low|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bt:  this is presumable a strong rase, a minimum and maybe slam invitation no shortness |pg||
nt|game over: 5@h is an easy make for experts (without a diamond lead), you have a 100% endplay by drawing trumps, eliminating clubs and playing @s A, @s J)|pg||
nt|bt:  6@H is on a finesse and a little more|pg||
nt|game over: in 6@h (after a spade lead) you should probably draw trump, finesse in diamonds eliminate clubs and diamonds (partially) and exit with a spade |pg||
nt|game over: after a non-spade lead it gets better|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bt:  this is a normal slam for a norwegian pair, buthese guys are from monaco so they might  stop|pg||
