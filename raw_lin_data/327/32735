nt|kareno:  Declarer should get this right.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: voice commentary discussing merit of 1@S transfer over DBL|pg||
nt|kareno:  You don't force your partner to ruff a meaningless card when it will expose his trump holding.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many benefits  not limited to:   responder has more sequences to desribe more hand types, doubler is on lead, facilitates differentiating 3/4 fit [when trf to major]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in context of nebulous opener -- can describe 1 vs 2 suited minor length|pg||

nt|kareno:  Maybe 1st and 4th?  They can elect either set of seeding rights|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: thinking, Nunes reading Daily bulletin|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that means other team must sit their players before team with seating rights decides lineup|pg||
