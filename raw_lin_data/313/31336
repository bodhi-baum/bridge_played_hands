nt|runnerup:  not a clain sailing because 3-0 in @s and @d ace off but @c Kx ..|pg||

nt|BSpiljak: how could Bocchi pretend he has club king?|pg||
nt|shengabus:  can't pitch a club (otherswise @c J 1 pitch, then ... the 5th? ... I dunno|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: lead 6? 4? nine?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I think 2@c showed @d so N might lead the @dA|pg||
nt|shengabus:  The difficulty is if declarer can get A@c then ruff, dropping the King, then @c position clear|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tryed slam|pg||

nt|BSpiljak: pushing lead well over 60|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in case you double hands like this -you must have 1nt artifical -difficult -but leads to @c fit|pg||
nt|shengabus:  The 2=4=2=5 double is always a toughie|pg||
nt|shengabus:  If you make this sort of double, it's good to use 1NT to show diamonds|pg||
nt|shengabus:  (partner bids 2@d with an actual t/o double, else bids 2@c)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  both minors even maybe|pg||
