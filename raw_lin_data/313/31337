nt|marlowepi:  unfortunately for him clubs are 4-1, but that is actually not terrible news because it may mean 3N fails too|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  E can see that if S lacks heart ace he has opened on 9 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: Overtake and play trumps?|pg||

mb|1C|nt|marlowepi:  when your agreed suit is spades, there is less tactical pressure to favor the big preempt than when it is hearts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi:  S has an interesting choice, many  --  perhaps most  -- would bid 1H but do you like your hand well enough to double for takeout on the next round, especially at these colors? it is a genuine problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: what's your tactical approach here, double or 1@H? I tend to bid 1@S when having 5 spades and 4 hearts, what about these holdings?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|marlowepi:  right, it is not a comfortable situation since you cannot later conveniently explore possibilities in the other major while allowing for preference at the 2 level|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbg: I bet South initial double would make decision a little easier here for North|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi:  E sort of unlucky that the 3rd D in the W hand is not a heart instead, though the abundance of controls in the E hand does suggest that NS who have bid 5H at unfavorable colors, when all S did was overcall, have at least 11 hearts|pg||

mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|HedyG:  what now? X or 5@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|HedyG:  hard for Fantoni to believe after the X by S and a free 4@H bid vulnerable by N that A@S is in N|pg||
nt|HedyG:  the hammer coming down on any further bid by N|pg||
nt|HedyG:  NS are a new partnership, not sure Pachtman doesnt expect more for a vulnerable t/o from his pd|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzbn: i think Pachtman alerted Tarnovski's pass over 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: if pass was forcing, 500 is cheaper than 550 :)|pg||
nt|HedyG:  it is pretty common usage to play pass as forcing when you have bid a vulnerable game and opps sacrifice. just here it was not a sac|pg||
nt|HedyG:  yes S had the option to double 5@c but as Ognjen says, that is 550|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: closed room bid 6@c over 5@h|pg||
nt|HedyG:  at the OT they pushed E into 6@cX -1|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  it looks to me as if double-dummy you can make 6C even on a spade lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  win ace, ace of trumps and then top diamonds. N ios caught in what is know as the Coup d'Agonie|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  if he ruffs high you discard your last losing spade and you can handle the rest. if he ruffs small, you overruff, play ace and ruff a heart then repeat the process|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  defense is not maxing out here|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi:  not realistic, but a spade lead ducked would probably fetch 800|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  early spade removes dummy entry to club queen, and it is essential (though very unrealistic) not to play diamonds as otherwise E cannot get off lead to his advantage|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  EW can make several games of course. 3H makes it hard to bid a slam, though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|mc|8|nt|marlowepi:  if W got really bullish and had the bid available for this purpose, a 4N call to show this sort of hand would maybe provoke E into bidding 6C. but again it is unrealistic because ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|marlowepi:  EW really underachieved there on defense, so that rates to be a significant IMP loss|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|slam try|mb|p|mb|3N|an|slam try|nt|marlowepi:  S reaped a big reward with his bold action there  --  though on some occasions with this same layout the IMPs could have flowed the other way|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|c3|nt|marlowepi:  otherwise he might finesse, just in case E has club AQ and W has 4 good spades and heart queen|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he could afford to lose heart finesse if spades are 33 as W is then not in to lead a club so AK of hearts can hold the club losers to one|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  sorry if spades are 32|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  lots of typos when you write fast, sorry|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  there was some danger in breaking diamonds ... W is of course very unlikely to have a stiff since he led a heart from a poorish suit, but E might have a singleton|pg||
