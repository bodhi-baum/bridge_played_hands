mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  3NT is not the correct bid with a minimum|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that might tip them off to the right lead sometimes, but i think in this situation it's better to bid the hand a bit more scientifically|pg||
nt|djneill:  some pdships are all about the stoppers, and some are all about the minor suit fit, West may be thinking 3red would indicate a great club fit or max|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|jesperdall:  But...they land on their feet - might easily end up in a no play slam here|pg||

nt|athene: a kibitzer says that 3nt shows 4333|pg||
