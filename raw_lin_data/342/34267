nt|padampadam:  I think Volcker will have to finesse in @d to make, and ruff a @c|pg||
pc|d9|nt|padampadam:  the finesse is automatic though, Lindqvist has alredy shown the @hA and has pass over 1@d|pg||
nt|Tez: or ace of @d ..@d ruff..ace of @s and @s..@d ruff..|pg||
nt|padampadam:  with the @dK also we can trust we would have acted over 1@d (1NT for exemple)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, but not quietly|pg||
nt|ritong: with north hand, if they make five it would not be a surprise|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jesperdall:  No matter, down two, for a pick up of around 8 imps for France - well done|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|MAXLAM: 10 @h + 9 @s = 19 total tricks NS makes 10 EW 8 . The law fails . Reason: hands are not pure.|pg||

nt|ritong: i do not think so|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|minip: NO|pg||
nt|JosJ: cashing @SA implies @H finesse is right?|pg||
nt|minip: But probably 6 @h as he has a 1NT available for balanced hands|pg||
nt|ritong: simply shows extra guts|pg||
