mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: 2@D shows any 8+|pg||
nt|adriaantje: and is GF|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: 6@S played by North may have had a chance|pg||
nt|adriaantje: 6@S by south is down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose you might make 6@s, if West does not lead a diamond|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: or indeed a heart|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: 3NT is non-serious, so mildly interested in slam|pg||
pc|c4|nt|adriaantje: oh sorry|pg||
nt|adriaantje: they're playing serious 3NT, I thought otherwise|pg||
nt|adriaantje: that seems like a bit of an overbid|pg||
nt|adriaantje: although she has nice HCP|pg||
nt|dburn: well, she has plenty of controls and a side suit that could provide a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|adriaantje: but she has already showed 16+ while only holding 15|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: so a slam-positive move seems indicated, despite being minimum in terms of points|pg||
pc|s9|nt|adriaantje: this looks like 2 IMPs to the Dutch, 4@S +2|pg||
