pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: nice 5@C   that was more encouraging than 4@C -- but full credit to NS|pg||
mc|12|nt|ahollan1: just too tough to bid confidently after the interference|pg||
nt|KingCur: as predicted, settling for 5, and an 11 imp win to Romania for obstructing EW's bidding, well done|pg||
nt|shengabus:  if in doubt, bid.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H usually less than game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW having trouble getting into the auction   but they'll have more chances|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|ahollan1: wow    confess that i didn't expect 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from East :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdc: west is also surprised about that|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: many pairs play  immediate 2@D = natural over the nebulous 1@D |pg||
nt|007 joosth: nowadays people are bidding on very little HCP.  That's why many play 1NT as natural again in this position.|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|ahollan1: i'm not surprised that 1N is natural   just thought hand wasn't quite good enough in "sandwich" position|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: yes indeed a minimum  but nor vulnerable|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: very nice handling by EW|pg||

pc|d2|mc|12|nt|ahollan1: i wonder what happens if:   a) van Prooijen tries 1@S instead of 1@H  b) they played Reverse Flannery where 1@D-2@H = 5@S 4+@H non-invite|pg||
nt|007 joosth: I would be disappointed if the Dutch pair would miss this cold slam however.   But indeed:  very good bidding.|pg||

nt|HedyG: 10 30 AM CET|pg||
nt|KingCur: (watching the sizzling end of Italy-Urugay now) :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hedy in some parts of the [where i've lived]  people have no clue what CET stands for |pg||
nt|ahollan1: they can't find Faroe Islands on map either  |pg||
nt|HedyG: Central European Time|pg||
nt|HedyG: and they cant google either?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just my slur about  usa public skool system|pg||
nt|HedyG: skool is right :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i recall  someone saying     "practice makes perfect"   but the retort is   "what if you practice the wrong thing?"|pg||
nt|007 joosth: you can learn from your mistakes?  :)|pg||
nt|HedyG: who does?|pg||

mc|7|nt|007 joosth: could Verhees have played the heart K instead of the Jack?    then maybe N would have played a spade now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and interesting non-cover by declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joost   i'm not sure  but think order of play turns out not to matter     but maybe good guessing can restrict to -1|pg||
nt|007 joosth: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: win @HA finesse @D, win 2nd diamond in hand  ruffing finesse in @H   is that enough to save a trick?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe unable to get back to hand for 4th round of @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  this is last board of the match/day|pg||
nt|007 joosth: it seems diff to me, esp. when N plays a 3rd spade in time which should be ruffed high|pg||
