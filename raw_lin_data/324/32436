nt|babs59: 3NT probably shows 15-17 whereas 2NT shows 12-14 or 18+|pg||

nt|Roofman:  it's nice to see both tables to be playing the same boards at the same time.|pg||
nt|babs59: esp since they've been runners up last 2 years|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: many thanks to all our super-commentators|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Roofman:  Yes, congratulation to Tony, Fee, Matthew, Hugh, Mike & Geo.  4th time lucky!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Roofman:  Juz tells me that they were runner up 3x in a row|pg||
nt|babs59: I can't remember that far back :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|babs59: but I played with Fiona in 2011...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|babs59: and we didn't make the final - and nor did Hugh's team :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|babs59: I just remembered - we both made the Round of 4 and Hugh refused to choose our team - and we both lost!|pg||
nt|babs59: I know who was runner up that year - someone I have since married :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: i should tell Matthew that he man make ANY bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: can make|pg||
nt|babs59: and obviously Matthew was the added-touch the McGann team needed!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: in fact, Matthew told Fee that he 'always' wins finals - they just had to get there... esp when they qualified 6th|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: he lost in Canberra ..i think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|babs59: not last year, but yes this year he did!|pg||
