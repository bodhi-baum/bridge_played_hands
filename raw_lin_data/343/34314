mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|davisbiz:  Well that might have been true as well, but I think it was simpler than that - simply the best outcome compared to other opening bids; right mix of offence/defence. Don't know how scientific it was as I havent read the original |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D could be keycard in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: in which case 5@D is looking for the @SK|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|athene: sometimes you get these auctions where both players think they are the one bidding blackwood |pg||
nt|athene: but i am sure NS know whether it is 4@D or 4NT which is actually blackwood :)|pg||
nt|athene: ah, sorry, 4NT is not the right response for 4@D being RKCB|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: ok so north took control, found the three aces, now he wants the @SK for 7|pg||
nt|athene: or something useful extra|pg||
nt|athene: 7@C is a very interesting exercise in percentages|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't expeect this to make on a trump lead|pg||
nt|Turbin: I counted 25 per cent (without seeing opps cards)|pg||
nt|athene: on a small trump lead do you rise with the ace so you can ruff two diamonds without losing to the @C10?|pg||
nt|Turbin: It needs diamond finesse and @S finesse or squeeze @H-@S|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  IMonaco have had big losses on this board and 30; they bid the grand but did not make it|pg||
nt|athene: yes, i have to say, unless there are hidden meanings to the auction, i don't see how south can justifiably bid 7@C here|pg||
nt|athene: if he is going to bid 7 why not just do it over 5@D?|pg||
nt|athene: if south bid a very slow 6@C, north surely can't possibly bid 7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: sorry i don't see how *north* can justifiably bid 7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|athene: basically 5nt says "can we make 7?" and 6@C says "no"|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: but a slow 6@C says "well.... no, but maybe yes"|pg||
nt|athene: so how can north raise that?|pg||
