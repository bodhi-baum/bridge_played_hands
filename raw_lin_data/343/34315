nt|ahollan1: if he had 4-card major he would show it [conventionally] over 3@C|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugraphzcn: Welland comments: "Nice bidding"|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: given your minor-suit holdings you need quite a layout to beat the contract and quite often you need four spade tricks, so I  think if it was wrong not by a wide margin|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@S = mild slam invite  [a bit weaker than 1N-4N]|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 4@S either denies  or just implies no 4-card major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure|pg||
