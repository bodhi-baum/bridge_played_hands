pc|c4|nt|marlowepi: with the 9 :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: someone suggests he can ruff and play a diamond so declarer doesn't need the club ruff - but that is just a grosvenor|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Great play to lead a heart from South - but what does he make of the non-ruff?|pg||
nt|athene: if you wanted to protect your partner's trump length you would force with a club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grosvenor coup would be wonderful  in front of thousands of viewers|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E doesnt know much about the S spade length, and S knows he doesnt know, and E knows S knows|pg||
nt|ahollan1: grosvenor coup   basically  you give player an option that he wouldn't have on his own|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so basically you always ignore the new chance|pg||
nt|athene: this is a bit like "representing" a hand in poker - you have to keep track of about five things|pg||
nt|athene: what your opponent has - what you have - what he thinks you have - and what you want him to think you have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ruff @H and lead @D might qualify as double grosvenor|pg||
nt|athene: probably what they are really thinking about is where to go for dinner|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is the indicated strategy in a context of sufficient information so that you know that opponents know a lot. that isnt the case here|pg||

nt|athene: i guess you lead the jack first|pg||
nt|athene: then you can, in theory, pick up @SQ9xx and @SQxxx onside, although you have a guess later maybe|pg||
nt|athene: but that really would be a self-grosvenor|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Man, this is a great almost-final board!|pg||
