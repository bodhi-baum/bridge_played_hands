nt|jesperdall:  Reflecting on the score in this match: Sweden might just as well have picked up imps on boards 23 and 30 - so The Great Shuffler has played his usual part in this match too|pg||
nt|runnerup:  all tricks here almost automaticly|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west has MM|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in 7 your play is different |pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Well, declarer may fear hearts are 6-1|pg||
nt|runnerup:  and surely some ruffs ..so may take  only 12|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Perhaps: Win in hand, ruff a spade, three rounds of clubs ending in dummy, spades|pg||
nt|nilsland:  he can play for spades being no worse then 4-2 as Jesper just mentioneed|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or finess in @D and take some ruffs|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2 lady has made 7 @c ..they are better|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I am sure he'll play for spades 3-3 or 4-2 as suggested|pg||
