nt|gracelin: Also thank my fellow commentator Sylvia for an excellent work.  He helped to explain many Canadian's auction. |pg||
nt|gracelin: Declarer can forsee a 5-0 trump break.  He is working on how tocope with that.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Unfortunately he may only be able to settle for -1 but not a make.|pg||
nt|sylviash:  unfortunately d1 on best defense and play |pg||
nt|sylviash:  a good contract without the trump break|pg||
nt|gracelin: The strategy by Korbel was totally sensible.  Remember every imp doesn't count the same.  Every imp he recovers here maybe twice valuable to the imps he is conceding here . |pg||
nt|gracelin: take DA and run 4 round of spade maybe his only chance, hoping for East to start with 4-5-1-3 dist.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Next match is schedule to start 37 minutes from now.  But this table is a little behind.|pg||
nt|sylviash:  other table is still on board 30 |pg||
nt|gracelin: And Canada recovered 11 imps by went down in 4H while the other side had an easy spade game.|pg||
nt|gracelin: North in open room didn't open his QJxxxxx and out hand with a weak 2S as did here.|pg||
nt|sylviash:  N at the other table did not have a weak 2@s available to him |pg||
nt|sylviash:  and this is a little too bad for a weak 3@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: Oh yes.  They play Fatunes style two opening.|pg||
nt|sylviash:  maybe they will reevaluate their decision to play fantunes style in the near future now that the success of the system has been tainted |pg||
nt|gracelin: very true.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know this is a critical hand but I don't see many options for north to think for so long.|pg||
