pc|sJ|nt|thak: I think declarer can use his 2 entries to play @Hs twice towards the table and still ruff the 4th @H|pg||
nt|thak: wins @SK, @H to K and @C|pg||
nt|thak: I don't see a defence to this line|pg||
nt|thak: 2 @Hs, 1 @D , 3 top @S, a @H ruff in hand & @C ruff on table|pg||
nt|thak: @SK @H to K & @C say E goes up to back a 2nd @S win in hand & 2nd @H|pg||
nt|thak: think this is end of defence|pg||
nt|thak: can't be prevented from ruffing a @H in hand or @C on table|pg||
nt|thak: if declarer goes after @Ds..|pg||

nt|thak: think declarer needs to play a @C now|pg||

nt|NKGupt: @h ruff seems only way to make|pg||
nt|NKGupt: that is DD|pg||

nt|thak: say ruff the @H8 & concede a @C, W wins cashes @DQ on which E is pretty much forced to pitch @H|pg||
nt|thak: now E ruffs a @D & backs a @S, I don't see it making|pg||
nt|thak: is GIB advising playing @H8 & ducking?|pg||
nt|NKGupt: @h and duck cud not help dec's cause|pg||
