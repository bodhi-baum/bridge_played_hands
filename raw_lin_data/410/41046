nt|game over: from West's point of view a slam is certainly possible; he just needs five spade-tricks (two diamond discards) and five heart tricks, so something like @s AQ @h KQ would give him ...|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Levin had a minimal hand for his GF Jump Shift to 3@d|pg||
nt|sommer:  as I see it, only @Hlead sets 6@S|pg||
mb|5N|nt|sommer:  ..and why on Earth should W lead @H5??|pg||
nt|game over: surely you can go back with the @c A, but then you cannot cash the diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer:  5+2+4+1 =?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  5NT is now almost always "Pick A Slam" as it is here in the Majors|pg||
nt|sommer:  ..only problem for S is keeping @Hentry|pg||
nt|sommer:  ..thats why I say, @Hlead sets it|pg||
nt|aardv:  6NT by South, that makes|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Levin can bid 6@c to send it back to Weinstein :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|sommer:  maybe the MA-Q makes the right conclusion?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  S will bid 6@s now|pg||
nt|sommer:  ..should;)|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  S cannot call 6NT with a singleton, and has the @c tenance|pg||
nt|sommer:  his @H's are not "good"|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ritong: i said in another room reaching 6@s would be an achievement  the key 3@s bid might do it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|sommer:  wow!!..I bet he can count to 12..and make it - without a @Hlead!|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Watching the Nickell Team as Op for a long time leads to familiarity with their style|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Night from the USA, congrats for a nice match to Nickell :)|pg||
nt|sommer:  agree Thorvald..W has an "obvious" @Clead imo too|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Just need to listen to David - simulations shows its not that obvious|pg||
nt|Mbodell:  thanks all for the the good match, night as well.|pg||
nt|game over: restart in 35 minutes|pg||
nt|thorvald:  Players are better bidding slams, so the aggressive leads is no longer that obvious|pg||
