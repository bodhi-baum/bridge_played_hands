mb|1N!|an|strong|nt|warrens:  without looking, just seems likely|pg||
nt|warrens:  One of the nice advantages of a Polish Club is the ability to play 1NT with 18-19|pg||

nt|MrAce:  S has lousy jacks but very good texture in spots|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|warrens:  do you know their opening NT range?  is it 15-17?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|MrAce:  yup|pg||

nt|ritong: he still is a great declarer|pg||
nt|warrens:  not anymore without help from the defense|pg||
nt|ritong: baloo is surely considering playing two rounds of @cs throwing the @hs|pg||
nt|warrens:  It was possible before if he played a @D after the J of @C's held. Put's East under a lot of pressure, squeezing him out of the 13th @H and sets up an endplay.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  i think he has to play for @SK onside, no?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: he is certain that east has the @h A  doubt about the @s K|pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  then East can simply cash the A of @H's and exit a @S.  his partner will get a @D for the 5th trick.|pg||
nt|warrens:  (after two rounds of @C's pitching 2 @H honors)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: DuBoin has already put his club on the table, but Balicki is thinking still|pg||
nt|MrAce:  if he discards @Hs, E will simply take @C and  play back @C|pg||
