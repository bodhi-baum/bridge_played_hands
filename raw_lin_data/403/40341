nt|ahollan1: make that ONLY  8 teams|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|nt|TopWizard:  It has dropped precipitously from the 12 or 13 a year ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd/4th  1N = 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|TopWizard:  The Board of Directors mentioned that they were monitoring this particular Event|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: isn't Michielsen too young to pass in 2nd seat?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kit: This was not the time for the short suit lead|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Perhaps not too young to have gone for a number with a spotless 12 balanced :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that said  i bet Edgar Kaplan would NOT have opened a weak NT [12-14] with south hand|pg||
nt|kit: But the defense can still recover I believe|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  S must shift to a @h immediately it seems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  NT spot leads are attitude|pg||
nt|kit: A nice play might be to overtake the spade and take the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|kit: That would lead South to believe her partner has more than 3 spades, so less likely to have 4 hearts|pg||
nt|kit: I'm assuming South will duck the spade|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: CC doesn't discuss difference of high/2nd from bad suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kit: But if South wins, she must shift to a heart immediately|pg||

nt|kit: Of course it might not be so simply -- South may have discarding problems on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Thanks super Op Maya :)|pg||
nt|kit: Particularly if South shifts to a small heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Smith EVER apply when dummy holds QJT?|pg||
nt|kit: So best defense is king of hearts and a heart, ducked, but that would be very difficult to find|pg||

nt|kit: If West opens 3@C, what will East try?|pg||

mb|4D|nt|TopWizard:  I would disagree w/3@c, ratty 6-card suit, Vul, 6-3-2-2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: shows my lack of imagination|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: Looks like they are headed for 5@C, which appears to be the winner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but if doing commentary of Kit - i think  what would I open - then ADD 1|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  I also disagree w/4@d, only 7-cards and outside values, a near opener|pg||
nt|kit: 3rd seat Gary|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and KQT9 looks like 5 cards|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  W will be disappointed in the @c layout here, but not surprisingly, same layout at other table :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D was 'more preemptive' than 4@D -- go figure|pg||
nt|kit: West will be pleased at the club layout -- means 6@C not making, and maybe not 3NT either.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: welcome Mark Tolliver -- soon to travel to Chennai India to compete in D'Orsi Senior Bowl|pg||
nt|kit: Of course she was a bit unlucky -- after all North did open 4@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS will be there too - playing in the Venice Cup|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Go Mark!  Be 1st or 2nd behind USA1 :)|pg||

pc|d8|nt|winkle:  3N can make if declarer reads that diamonds are 7-2 and lead a low spade toward the jack, but it seems more likely she'll try the club finesse instead.|pg||

nt|winkle:  i don't see how declarer can get this right.  north's 2@D is unexpectedly strong.|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||

pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|ritong: she is known to have @d KQxxxxx, so the explanation for not opening 3@d is she has a side card|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
mc|7|nt|ritong: so it all was in reading the opening lead|pg||

nt|kit: well, club finesse might lose|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  But then N can't get a @h ruff|pg||
nt|kit: But here line fails only if the 4@D opener has KJx of clubs|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Or K10x of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: No, but if club finesse loses North cashes a diamond, and then she has to guess the clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|villain:  also only fails if n has a stiff heart (or void) and more than 1 club|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Missing J and 10, would be 2-2 as you hypothesized|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Normal auction to 2@S, which should be pretty easy on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Indeed, so if 2-2 then finesse would make overtrick|pg||
nt|kit: but if she takes club finesse and it loses, then what does she do?|pg||

nt|winkle:  this gives declarer 2 heart entries to hand, but i still don't see a way to make it doulbe dummy.|pg||
nt|ritong: there is none imo|pg||

nt|ritong: a genuine bad luck strike|pg||
nt|winkle:  not to mention she cannot see that she needs to take the spade finesse.|pg||

nt|ritong: so, push and pray for a good flop|pg||
nt|ritong: i would define the flop as mediocre|pg||
pc|s4|nt|winkle:  cards are positioned well for declarer, but she lacks dummy entries.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|winkle:  note the club spots.  low club now will allow declarer to set up the club suit with just one entry to dummy.|pg||
nt|ritong: benedicte will take this and play a @d, i guess|pg||
nt|winkle:  if declarer sets up 4 clubs she would probably make.|pg||
nt|ritong: for one, it sets whenever pard has a @d card|pg||
nt|winkle:  it seems that the cards still favor declarer.  east can't really do anything to set up 5 tricks.|pg||
nt|ritong: but she has to consider her next discard(s)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: How about win A and return @H|pg||
nt|ritong: and also how declarer might press her|pg||
nt|ritong: try this with stiff @h Q|pg||
nt|winkle:  i don't see any winning defense.  if declarer wins and plays heart, declarer can play a low club next so long as he guesses clubs he will get 4 clubs, 2 spades, 3 hearts, and 1 diamond.|pg||
nt|winkle:  if defense wins the heart, i mean|pg||
nt|winkle:  you can pick up 4 clubs by playing low to jack, then go to dummy and play the 9 smushing the 8.|pg||
nt|winkle:  or low to 9, more likely but same thing.|pg||
nt|ritong: for our specs who say " but she can t beat it", the question is more what she should do and why|pg||
nt|ritong: anyone can click the "gib" button, i mean|pg||
nt|ritong: her elements are: she does not know how @hs are made and she does not know if pard has a @d honor|pg||
nt|winkle:  the cards are pretty marked|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|winkle:  south overcalled 3N with bare 15.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: when declarer plays the @h10, she has 109 for sure  simply can t afford to throw a trick when @h Q is onside and stiff  so, the only reasonable chance is playing that south has ...|pg||
nt|ritong: balanced on 13, which can happen, and find pard with @d Q|pg||
