mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  avoiding 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Final board and a big win for Monaco. Tough to have to face them in this mood.|pg||

mb|2C|an| |mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|paulg:  I've seen Fantoni and Nunes play in 3NT when they have a major fit more than any other world-class pair|pg||
mb|2S|an| |mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  in the CR Helgemo X 1H, which made 4@s less attractive|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South's strong opening deterred Alujas from entering the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  some declarers have made 4@s after West was in the auction|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  Bocchi was one declarer at least who made 4@s but he had a X|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a TOD vul against not by a passed hand must show a singleton in suit opened|pg||
nt|paulg:  you can only make it by double finessing in hearts, a 3-3 break must be more likely with no bidding by the opponents|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Fantoni thinking whether to try 3@h with a view to drwaining trumps ending in dummy|pg||
nt|paulg:  the one line he is not thinking of is a spade to hand and running the @h8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if his trump spots were better, he could draw 2 rounds of trumps and evalaute once he discovers the trump break|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I predict Argentina will finish with a small consolation|pg||

nt|paulg:  on another day hearts will be 3-3 and clubs 5-2, it's just bridge|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a doubleton @h with West would be OK|pg||
