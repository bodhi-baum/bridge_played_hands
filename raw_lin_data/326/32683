mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Could EW end on a @H slam here?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Seems easy to make, maybe hard to bid but "state of match"?|pg||
mb|2D|an|gf|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jkdood: 2@D is probably game forcing, since 2@C was available|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|sixela: they are down 28, with 16 boards to go, hardly time to push due to state of the match|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe - was expecting West to rebid 2@h (though 1NT is sensible), after which East could bid 4@d...|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d3|mc|12|nt|jkdood: After 1@h p 1@S -p 2@H, much easier perhaps|pg||
nt|jkdood: Thank you all.|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but this way East was expecting an all-round balanced hand, not a sixth heart and a bunch of top cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: back after the short break|pg||
