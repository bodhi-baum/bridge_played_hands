nt|eieio: NS can make 5@C if they guess hearts right|pg||

nt|eieio: The play of 4@H is a little bit more complicated|pg||
nt|lorderic: which they are not going to reach after the 2NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|eieio: N 3@C, S 4@C or 3@H/3@S|pg||

nt|by:  north is not consistent if he thinks that partner has short spades he should it it in if he thinks that partner is short he really should try for a game with @dKJ|pg||

nt|lorderic: @DKJ definitely helps. but is that enough for a game? I am not sure|pg||
