nt|lorderic: if S does have 4 hearts, he might pass now and lose 6@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|an|minor OR !S+!H|nt|lorderic: NS can make several @S|pg||
nt|by:  This is when you need a fast signoff in diamonds|pg||
nt|by:  and north will think that partner have @d|pg||
nt|by:  and NS will fail to locate the fit, so, 3@d any which way you can now ......|pg||
nt|lorderic: you mean N would think S has @C BY?|pg||
nt|by:  yes, that was a typo on my part|pg||
mb|r|nt|lorderic: i believe redbl shows "i have a suit"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|lorderic: that gives NS a chance to find their @S fit|pg||
nt|by:  It is important to be quick in this situation|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|by:  and it is important to tailor your method to the opponents; weaknesses|pg||
nt|lorderic: N thinks "both major? you must be kidding me"|pg||
nt|by:  So one should always have a fast signoff in a minor|pg||
mb|3S|mb|3N|mb|4S|nt|by:  this also shows the importance of showing at least one of your majors quickly; Astro variants or gladiator (Lionel) would immediately get you to spades|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's not everyone's agreement, but i agree that against this convention a fast signoff is strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  By the way, the way that the auction has gone, seems to indicates a misunderstanding for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|by:  So now east would likely double ....|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|lorderic: doubling 3NT would be +300 NS, although 4@S is not dead either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: 5@D definitely gets the double|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|by:  to have a chance of beating 4@s, E must lead @sAx then another @s when he is in with @dk|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|d2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|by:  but from the way the auction went, it looks as if E took his partner's pass for a forcing pass|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lorderic: N didn't find the @C lead - cannot blame him|pg||
nt|by:  and it seems like a very bad result for NCTU|pg||
nt|lorderic: if declarer plays @C correctly only -1|pg||
nt|lorderic: -1 for -100 is not that bad. NS has spade partscore or even making game|pg||
nt|by:  Yes, but compare that to 1N(X)3D making 4|pg||

nt|lorderic: covering @CQ helps declarer a little. but I think he would get it anyway|pg||
nt|lorderic: this hand might provide some excitement|pg||
nt|by:  especially if 4@Sx [1N-(X or 2@d showing spades or 2@c showing majors)-any-(4@s)] makes at the other table|pg||

nt|lorderic: EW can make 6@H on a non-@C lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|lorderic: well, not exactly - on a normal @S lead, W has to take care of his two little @S|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:  You can play 0314 to avoid this double, now 6@H is not a good choice|pg||
nt|lorderic: this lead directing double is essential|pg||
nt|lorderic: W definitely figures out that his 6@H chance drops dramatically after the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|Kyosuke326:  so 6@D now? however, @H ruff kill this slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: pass giving E a chance to redbl to show his first-round control|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lorderic: against 6@D, N has to win the first trump to give his partner a ruff. by the bidding it should not be difficult|pg||
mb|5H|nt|lorderic: i don't think W will pass here. even if he decides not to bid slam, he is likely to correct to 5@H|pg||
nt|lorderic: there it is|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:  in East's view, if only one key cards missed, 6@D is still have a chance|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:  He cares about !Q more than @H 4-0 distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|lorderic: our west player, PY Lin, has been representing Taiwanese junior team in previous year|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lorderic: he might be the most solid player on this table in my opinion|pg||

nt|by:  and unclear whether W will run or should run|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:  North maybe think that "pd dbl 5@C and I have @DA"|pg||
nt|lorderic: the double is unsure. S can be stiff in @D|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:  The double is not base on "pd can ruff @H" I think...|pg||
nt|lorderic: CR stops in 5@H|pg||
