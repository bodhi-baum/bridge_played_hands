nt|marlowepi: i think even covering the ten of hearts would have done iit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Sheila A:  It's difficult for the defence to attack any suit effectively|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the duck of the second round of clubs, though, was especially mysterious|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|paulg:  Even second in hand, vulnerable against not, the South hand too strong for the a NS weak 2@h|pg||

mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Sheila A:  It felt inevitable that W would bid 5@d eventually|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Unfortunately for Coyle, Wilkinson has obvious lead and continuation|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: W is not bidding weakly, for sure, but I doubt 3D was forcing, so maybe he was trying to get doubled. for me, though, it is a striaghtforward 3H overcall, especially with E a ...|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|d2|mc|10|nt|marlowepi: on this layout, sure, but it would seem there are an awful lot of hands where you can take nine but not eleven. and W can contribute a few tricks toward that nine|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: he bid his hand coyly :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  however, once his partner volunteered 2@c he probably thought he'd made the right decision|pg||
mb|p|pc|sT|nt|Sheila A:  This could go a few off|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h is just weak, not necessarily a two-suited hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: wants EW to lead that suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  McPaul deciding that he doesn't really want the lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Sheila A:  EW can probably make 6@d but will be content with 800|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

pc|s3|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think a ruff with the 3 of hearts was indicated. if W had started with AKJ(x) of hearts, i doubt he would have led the ten of spades|pg||
mc|4|nt|paulg:  yes, i agree that this was the important clue|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: as opposed to just discarding i mean. just in case:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  I expect 3@c is natural and forcing|pg||
nt|paulg:  East would like to bid on, since West must have the @dK|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  No 2@h opened at the other table, so that's 3 imps to Great Britain.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6C easy without trump lead, and even then the 33 D break sees it to harbour|pg||
nt|paulg:  but if his hearts could be a lot stronger without the ace|pg||
nt|paulg:  and he needs no wasted values in spades with strong clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think he can count on good clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the other hand, there are very few hands where 5@c is worse than 3NT|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  Still, Coyle could be stronger for his bidding - it's a fairly minimal reverse|pg||
mb|5C|nt|marlowepi: I think E has to bid again. surely 3N is not the last making game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Sheila A:  Often 3NT won't be making at all, with such weak @s opposite shortage|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 4@c is probably better, given your diamond holding|pg||
nt|paulg:  but still very difficult to find the slam|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: personally I wouldnt expect shortage from W on this auction unless stiff king. i would expect 2425|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 1435, W would be more likely to bid out shape i think|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: i would normally agree with 4C, as you say, but they may play 5C as some kind of picture bid|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|sQ|mc|12|nt|marlowepi: anyway on the resent hand I would rebid 3D as W. He has a very nice reverse once clubs get supported, all primes and good shape and the key ace of hearts facing possible shortness. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N slows down the auction, yes, but 3D doesn exactly catapult it out of control. There is still time to play in 3N|pg||

nt|paulg:  4@d may be key-card blackwood?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: if so it would be a trifle declasse without a club control|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i suspect it was just forward-going but denying a club control|pg||
nt|marlowepi: o that now the 4H call by E guaranteed a club control as well|pg||

nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: But Scotland conuered the rest of the island too so one team is called great Britain|pg||
nt|paulg:  good switch by Bob McPaul, possibly forcing declarer to make a guess at trick two|pg||

nt|Sheila A:  Why not 3@d?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Like here, you mean?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3D and S bids 3S, there could be some confusion about a later 5N pick-a-slam bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4D over 2N, on the other hand, would avoid that trap|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think it was lack of methods and confidence that was the problem, rather than a misbid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but maybe 4D would have some other meaning, like KC, and N probably doesnt have good enough diamonbds for that call in any case. I like a direct 5N|pg||
nt|paulg:  6NT is "easy" bid|pg||
nt|barnets: why would north not just bid 6@D ?|pg||

pc|c7|pc|d7|nt|barnets: even 3@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well for a lot of us it means pick a slam any time it is not part of a RKCB sequence|pg||
nt|barnets: if that is nat followed by 5n|pg||
nt|barnets: his partner wont pick diamonds when he has 4|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  But why do you want partner to pick a slam when you know you want to play in @d?|pg||
nt|barnets: so pick a slam is out|pg||
nt|barnets: he know what to pick|pg||
nt|barnets: diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps they play better minor and South might be 3=4=3=3|pg||
nt|paulg:  then 6@d sounds too prescriptive|pg||
