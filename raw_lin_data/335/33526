mb|1N|mb|p|nt|game over: now one of the eternal questions for East: do you introduce spades or raise hearts immediately?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  At this level, systems are still being improved with experience on deals like this|pg||
nt|cc469: You mean this has never come up before in all the years they have been playing?|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like a one-bid hand.  I raise hearts.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|game over: interesting, at least a sequence like (1@d - Precision) 1@s - p - 1NT - p - 2@d should have come up, generalize from there ;) :)|pg||

pc|c4|nt|game over: some pairs don't raise to 2@s on three spades (perhaps a mistake); with a weak hand I agree, but there are some hands where this is not as clear (stronger hands or 5+@s)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: I think it is safer to raise on the East hand playing Precision, since partner is unlikely to get carried away being limited to 15|pg||

nt|kit: the question is which heart|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kit: If partner had AQJ tight, it would be right to lead the 10 and hope declarer covers (which declarer might).|pg||
nt|game over: we can see there is no problem, but Levin is thinking: What can I do about spades 4-1?|pg||
nt|kit: right|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|TopWizard:  AK and A is usually an opener, even for 12-14 1NT'ers|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|nt|kit: East will be competing to 3 of a minor, for sure.|pg||

pc|hA|nt|kit: Opponent known to have at least an 8-card fit (no 1@S overcall), and you certainly have at least an 8-card minor-suit fit.  How can sellling out none vul ever be right?|pg||
