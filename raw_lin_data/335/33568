nt|jkdood: OK, 2 for 2; but who's counting?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Dummy's 9 of @S is now a huge card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Cohler will not necessarily assume this lead is from JTx -- more likely Jx on the auction, given that W showed 5-5 in the black suits|pg||

nt|shuster:  Rosenkranz is to ask for the "highest unbid suit." |pg||
nt|kit: which has been known to happen|pg||

nt|kit: sorry, South to West|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: guess we'll await but west heard it afterwards, and was not perturbed|pg||

nt|shuster:  4@H was pretty bold with the South cards.  It has play though.|pg||
nt|kit: IMO West could and should ask|pg||
nt|kit: Very bold -- but it is just on the heart guess.|pg||
nt|kit: Which he may get wrong, since he needs West to have queen of clubs, so East likely to have queen of hearts for opening bid|pg||

nt|shuster:  What is the G/H NT range here?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: 13+-16|pg||
nt|shuster:  So it seems quite probably that East is 3343|pg||
nt|kit: They will open all 11 pointers, but still -- with queen of clubs needed in West hand .........|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think he can affod a discovery play in spades first|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|shuster:  If he tries to drop a doubleton club queen, he will succeed, only in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|kit: But if East has Qxxx of hearts, a fourth round of diamonds would defeat him.  And why couldn't that be the case?|pg||

nt|shuster:  By the way, 2nd seat equal vulnerability psyches are MUCH more believable than 1st seat favorable ones|pg||
nt|ganz:  haha|pg||
nt|kit: Rosenberg might just transfer and then 5NT, pick|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|kit: Or he might haul out the old-fashioned Gerber convention, since they could barely be off 2 aces|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|drewsky: What about transfer, then KC gerber, and then 5NT ?|pg||
