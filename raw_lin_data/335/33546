mb|p|nt|Fluffy: 6NT is stupid contract|pg||
nt|jkdood: "at first glance" my new verbage to cover my fast (mis)analysises :)|pg||
nt|Fluffy: starting with 0-7 on west hand has the problemthat you later have a lot to catch up|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6!N would indeed be embarassing with a @D lead it seems|pg||
nt|jkdood: All those clubs go to waste|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: heart towards the 10, north will cover but ends endplayed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: very nice 4@C call|pg||
nt|jkdood: Other room played just a game, so opportunity for a pickup here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: still a chance for false pref to 4@H here - but i bet 5@C|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes, Gonzalo, looks OK DD, with a few gray hairs earned along the way (6N)|pg||
nt|Fluffy: 5@c? he hasn't show any values yet|pg||
nt|Fluffy: he is bidding more|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: but @SKJxx known to be worthless opp likely 1543 or 0643|pg||
nt|Fluffy: @sK is wasted, but the rest is too good|pg||
nt|jkdood: Seems like West never showed @cs in other room; which might have lit East's fire|pg||
nt|jkdood: The @D Queen - altho stiff - is working well, can West sense it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: we have effectively the same auction in both rooms up to 4@C  with willenken 2@D = 0-1 controls|pg||
nt|jkdood: Thru 4@C both rooms have pretty much the same auction so far|pg||
nt|jkdood: In other room, a false preference to 4@H was then passed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: all synapses firing for diamond|pg||
nt|Fluffy: Diamond can bid 4@h, 5@c or I supose 4@s to show clubs|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some pairs agree that you can't make a forward going bid in a "stopping off" place like 4 of a major|pg||
nt|jkdood: SO if for example West had stiff @H Ace, he cannot use 4@H to show that|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|Fluffy: I've played 5-1 many times because of that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: As have we all, Gonzalo :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: diamond writing  but i can't see :(|pg||
nt|jkdood: Why not, Al, no tree pollen in Phx!!|pg||
nt|Fluffy: whatever 5@s is, it is not @sA since that would be 4@s then I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: ALL pollen in phx|pg||
mb|5N!|an|?pick-a-slam?|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: This part of the auction is most likely "seat of pants undiscussed"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: I think 5@s is a bluhmer bid, showing good hand with no spade wastage, perhaps diamodn is expecting a 0553 for this bidding|pg||
nt|jkdood: 12 imps gain to Diamond for the expected make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: cohler asking if understanding about 4@C   both answer undiscussed but general rule suggest nat|pg||
nt|jkdood: The play will go much much faster than the bidding|pg||

nt|jkdood: This lead holds it to 6, else 7 was possible|pg||

nt|Fluffy: a bluhmer bid is a jump in the suit partner has shortness(or a raise to splinter)|pg||
nt|jkdood: also try: http://www.bridgehands.com/B/Bluhmer.htm|pg||
nt|Fluffy: it shows a good hand with not much wasted in the suit bid|pg||

nt|pelu:  many play that 2Nt now is ! and 2@s ssec negativ|pg||
mb|4C|nt|warrens:  if 2NT shows values, might end up in 6NT, which is difficult on a @D lead (but still makeable)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Nice analysis Warren -- took me a while to see how 6NT can make on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|pelu:  as I see will @s to A and @d back kill 6NT|pg||
nt|kit: So the club fit is lost and so is the slam.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2nt showed some values (not second neg)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: rest natural I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Will:  sorry if we missed the club boat|pg||
nt|pelu:  EW could have used a spec gadjet: 2@c - 2NT = semipositiv and @c-suit|pg||
nt|warrens:  You have to go all out in 6NT on a @D, but it works.  Slam more likely to be found with the strong club system at the other table (I believe).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: sigh from Roseberg.   Hamp asks Greco if he thinks 4@C was slower than other bids.  Greco says all were in tempo.  Rosenberg says it was slower than the other bids|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: russinow from all lengths for NS|pg||

nt|runnerup:  slam makes so no big harm ,,just looks strange|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Hamp asks about tendency to bid @D vs NT.  Rosenberg says at this vul he usually bids 1@D with 6 or 7, bidding NT with slightly better hands|pg||
nt|kit: While I would probably respond 1@S, I can certainly see good arguments for 1NT.  In particular, Rosenberg has the sort of hand where 3NT might be right even with a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|kit: In addition, if the partnership often raises on 3, which I think they do, then responding 1@S could be pretty bad.|pg||
nt|poohbear: o|pg||
nt|kit: If 4-card support needed for raise (as I play), then 1@S a lot more attractive.|pg||
