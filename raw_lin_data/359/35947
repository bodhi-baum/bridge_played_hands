nt|BroLucius:  Hi, Yuan!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|shengabus:  Good morning David|pg||
mb|2D|nt|BroLucius:  Some action from Meckstroth. He could not bear another 1NT contract either.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  2@H usually to play now from East.|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  We do not have convention cards, so I have to guess about the bids, just as you do...|pg||
nt|shengabus:  If South bids, then 2@d was a Major; if South passes, then 2@d was @d+a major ...|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Could show spades, or be diamonds + a major.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  If that is natural, it is rather an unorthodox move.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shengabus:  East is perhaps most surprised.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  3NT on just 18 points would be stretching it. Yes, they have bid it. |pg||
mb|d|nt|BroLucius:  Only their reputation prevents a double from East.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|BroLucius:  No, sorry, East has doubled. Quite right!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shengabus:  I have a rule of thumb|pg||
nt|shengabus:  (for my level of play of course:) If you think the opponents are having a disaster after 1NT, they are.|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  If it is their style to bid on shape, and few points, 2NT (natural) is an overstatement.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  I am told that this is Becky Rogers' first event partnering the great Meckstroth.|pg||
nt|shengabus:  From the lead, it looks like 3/low against suit|pg||
pc|s7|nt|BroLucius:  The general idea about most defences to 1NT (to a strong 1NT, anyway) is to shunt the opponent out of a comfortable contract - at matchpoints, anyway. So, responder should keep the bidding low.|pg||
