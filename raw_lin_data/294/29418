mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|glenne:  this is obviously a troublesome hand, hard to go plus....John and Geof went minus 200 in three clubs other room|pg||
nt|glenne:  this not likely to fare too well either|pg||
nt|glenne:  probably same result|pg||
pc|c2|nt|glenne:  the defense has too many nines and tens for declarer's liking, besides the obvious kings, etc.|pg||

nt|reisig: Prob ...with the 10|pg||
nt|glenne:  dangerous point, might let declarer have his ninth trick before their fifth|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: now in thinker's man pose|pg||
nt|glenne:  that too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: very thoughtful and kind man|pg||

nt|glenne:  makes me feel better|pg||
nt|glenne:  that he is|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: do you make bad plays?|pg||
nt|glenne:  if i didn't we would be up seven instead of down seven|pg||
nt|reisig: No comment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: opens hand then closes fast and shakes his head|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: east looks like a statue|pg||
nt|glenne:  i make several of them, but i usually find something funny about them afterwards, so i'm okay with it. As long as i get a good story out of it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: this match was several tables down yesterday has been one of the ones with time problems|pg||
nt|glenne:  this team came together late, as Bob Wickham and I have never played before, and we've enjoyed the team, hope to keep it going a little longer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but with the score so close is understandable|pg||
nt|glenne:  that's one thing that rarely, if ever happens at my table though.....perhaps it would better if i DID have time problems now and then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: west now counting the played cards|pg||
nt|reisig: Time problems are OK --- if kinda rare|pg||
pc|dK|nt|glenne:  i think the expert community has done a pretty good job of self policing the well-know "slow" players....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: udca and reverse smith|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: r smith does not imply with the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|reisig: I used to play w PO Sundelin ...known to be SLOW!|pg||
nt|glenne:  the other day i had choice of playing against Barnet, or other table. When i found out other table was Matthew and Rubin I chose the fast table....|pg||
nt|reisig: We NEVER finished behind the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i had that match yesterday|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: believe it or not we were finished 35 minutes ahead|pg||
nt|reisig: Barnet?   Some day I'll tell you abt playing w him :) :)|pg||
nt|glenne:  lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mr Street keeps him going|pg||
nt|glenne:  years ago i played with him in sectional in Palm Beach....woman came by, asked him where he was from and when he told her she said she loved his accent and loved that he learned our language too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: grandovetter was telling schermer to hurry up the play was too slow|pg||
nt|reisig: with that @c discard ...it means @s is OK|pg||
nt|glenne:  the only hands Bob and Jerry have had problems with so far are slams off two aces, so i suggested this morning that they add Blackwood to their card, they agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: and i will let you know we are sitting in the COLD corner even the guys were complaining might have an effect here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i need to type to keep my fingers warm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: north is saying taking to much time|pg||
