nt|chip:  At the other table they played 3C which also went down 3.|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|dbl me:  EW wd be proud of themselves for reaching slam here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|dbl me:  W can take care of E's spade concerns.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip:  In some ways 2H makes things more complicated, particularly when bid 2N instead of 2S.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  agree|pg||
nt|chip:  Maybe 4N now by Levitina natural?|pg||
nt|chip:  Will be easier at the other table after W starts with a strong C.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  If I could make the opps vul. on every hand, I wd play strong club exclusively  ;-)|pg||
nt|chip:  Seems wrong for E to be thinking now. Seems 2N forced 3N, so should know what you plan to do next before doing that.|pg||
nt|chip:  Or perhaps checking on what your agreements are before bidding.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Good point...anticipation is a little-addressed but vital component of the game.|pg||
nt|chip:  6N is the best slam, cold unless spades 5-0 and good chances then.|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|5C!|an|2 w/ Q|mb|p|nt|chip:  4D is RKC in clubs I'd guess. So planning to just drive to slam (hopefully not in clubs).|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:  But chooses well.|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d2|nt|dbl me:  A great (and accurate) comment, that|pg||
nt|chip:  never showed spades at all. E is hoping for club and heart tricks.|pg||

nt|dbl me:  The 3C bid unalerted is perplexing to me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:  I'm sure 2N could have been a club signoff, so 3C was forced unless a really big hand.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

mb|p|nt|chip:  And our great operator Matt.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip:  Also of course, Thanks to Jan Martel (my lovely wife) for arranging the vugraph show.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dbl me:  And worth mentioning again, it takes all your concentration just to operate the Vugraph, but witness everything else our operator contributed...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: And last but certainly most important, the USBF and Jan martel for organizing a first class event, they treat the operators very well! Amen chip :+)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfk: I couldn't ask for a better temporary boss while I'm on vacation :) |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: Yes of course, I take this job very seriously!|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  That is evident.|pg||
nt|chip:  What was 3C? natural? if so, very unusual to play that way (though useful on this hand).|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzfk: Bernstein asked, Sanborn explained as natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chip:  W has hopes for a high club contract, though partner has a mostly unsuitable hand (no fit for clubs, given no spade support, is disappointing).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: But speaking as a fan of the game of bridge, I think we all remember watching viewgraph from china for some of the events (WMSG etc) where the operators were clueless, it ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: Can make 6 here on a non diamond lead :)? |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  W seems to have disregarded her pd's u enthusiastic 3n bid.|pg||
