nt|KingCur: good morning from Oostende!|pg||
nt|KingCur: morning david :)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Hi Cur, I assume this the one and only, legendary Benito Garozzo?|pg||
nt|KingCur: it is indeed|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Hurray! A candidate for greatest player who ever lived.|pg||
nt|KingCur: he has been playing with Romain Zaleski regularly on BBO the last time, and I assume it was practice for this tournament|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Even he cannot work much magic with that East hand.|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  A seemingly straightforward 6NT to launch this semi-final.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|KingCur: morning prakash :)|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|panja: we begin with a bumper hand and a self-peemption|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: Hi Cor|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  3@S appears to be a transfer to get North to play 6NT.|pg||
nt|panja: 2@D multi?|pg||
nt|panja: hi David|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Hi!|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  They are looking for a suit fit, which is a bit surprising with so many high card points. Normally best in NT.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|KingCur: 3@S as willing to play 3@S/4@H opposite a multi with weak two M makes sense yes, and 3NT then showing the strong NT hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  By playing in 6NT, you avoid the risk of a bad break in the suit you would otherwise choose as trumps.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|BroLucius:  You should always seek a safe lead against 6NT. Too risky to lead from honours because you may give a trick away. The chance of finding partner with a matching honour is low when they have the points for 6NT.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Even against a suit slam, recent computer simulation has shown that it is not so often a good idea to make an aggressive lead as was previously thought.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Ten tricks on top. Everything will work, as we can see.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|BroLucius:  South will say something. Players are very free with their response after intervention.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: You either double or support diamonds perhaps|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Decades ago, any action was regarded as a 'free bid' and assumed to show extra values. That never made any sense. You should bid while you can. (South will now pass to prove me wrong...)|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Some say that these matches are too short at 28 boards, but it is really a miracle that the organisers can fit in so many events in a relatively short time. Hard to imagine a better schedule than they already have.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2S|nt|BroLucius:  No doubt 2@S is described as weak on the card, but it will show good playing strength when vulnerable.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|BroLucius:  South will not like to double with only 3 hearts.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  3@S primarily looking for 3NT is partner has a spade stopper.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|BroLucius:  King lead often askes for count or unblock. @S6 (playing standard signals) would show 2 (or 1) and deny a spade honour.|pg||

pc|h3|nt|BroLucius:  The photos in the bulletins have been great, Traian.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  East perhaps hopes to put West on lead for a spade through declarer.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  West has to judge whether it is right to surrender two heart tricks for that privilege.|pg||
