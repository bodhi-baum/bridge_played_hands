mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jjsb:  i admit i am not sure about cc of the pair ... but as we can see they dont play strong nt.. |pg||

mb|2H!|mb|2S|nt|ganz:  vul against not with flat shape|pg||
nt|jjsb:  but 1) ur vulnerable against non and 2) u have too much loosers... |pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ganz:  normal for north to bid, but e-w were going for -800|pg||
nt|jjsb:  yes here EW got "lucky" that N distribution made a punishment not really possible |pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jjsb:  so they are just probably going to play the "normal 4@h contract most probably |pg||

pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|dQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jjsb:  the best defense is actually to play second @s and continue |pg||
nt|ganz:  lanzarotti no doubt looking at dummy, counting everyone's points and wondering if partner could possibly have any hand that leads to a set|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|jjsb:  apparently the nt is 14-16 as i have been told |pg||

nt|ganz:  3NT could so easily be better|pg||
nt|ganz:  Hi Danilo|pg||
nt|jjsb:  true craig |pg||
nt|ganz:  also with a strong hand, it's less important to preempt the level|pg||
nt|jjsb:  there is so many different version of gazzili... |pg||
nt|jjsb:  so its not really clear to know here what those bid means after 2@d |pg||
nt|danilo1: on third position, I would prefer 4@S opening bid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ganz:  for specs who haven't seen this before, gazzilli is a very popular convention where opener rebids 2C after 1H/1S-1NT, or 1H-1S, to show either clubs or extra values.  responder then can show if he has game values opposite the extras, and |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ganz:  otherwise you get to stay low. very good when opener has around 16 and doesn't have to make a jump rebid.|pg||
