nt|vugraphzdp: What's the equivalent of a penalty shoot out in bridge?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: The carry over of 8 IMPs has been included|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: if it actually should have been 8.1 IMPs maybe the decimal will be used as tiebreaker?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Though of course still boards to compare|pg||

nt|scotty: He might try to play West for @h8x - which will not succeed|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: Jason asks about 3@D. Green "weak" |pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason asks if there was "mixed raise available?" "No"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: The Chairman's team can win the event but not get a medal, so other three teams guaranteed the medals|pg||
nt|scotty: Or East for doubleton @sA - also will not succeed|pg||
nt|scotty: So I don't think he will make...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Called the Chairman's as lead by Commonwealth Bridge Chairman Paul Hackett, on a team with his sons|pg||

nt|eamongall: larger wattage bulbs often works |pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason ignores them and looks at opponents' convention card|pg||
pc|c5|nt|scotty: In the other room declarer in 4@s played @s to K and could have been 2 down the way the play went|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason: "What's the situation with Diamonds, does 1@D promise 5?" Holland: "Could be 4 if very strong, or 4441"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: "any 4441"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: jason asking specifically about what suit they open with "4144"|pg||
nt|scotty: East could have settled matters with a @s ruff - now declarer can make again - but not easy|pg||
nt|eamongall: Radisson Blu ...they should have some pretty good lights .. |pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Holland not sure, "probably 1@C"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: The hotel is very nice, ambient, but that's not pefect for bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Here goes Jason|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: This is a very close match so one game swing could decide it|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Other semi-final Wales well ahead of India|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Live scores here:|pg||
nt|scotty: He might take a "safety play in hearts of leading low to dummy.  This works if W started with J10, Q8xx, xxxx, QJ9 - doesn't seem very likely|pg||
nt|eamongall: Green might as well have given a ruff .. as Jason probably knows restricted choice :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: http://www.commonwealthbridgescotland.com/match/rank2.php|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: (live scores not started on Round 2 yet)|pg||
nt|scotty: But the fact that he failed to give the ruff means declarer is likely to misguess spades now...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason: "Do all balanced weak hands open 1@C" Holland: "unless 3352"|pg||
nt|eamongall: Is Feargal O'Boyle from Ireland doing the scoring ??|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason asking Holland a lot of questions, trying to figure this one out|pg||
nt|scotty: If he plays @hK, he might succeed by playing a @c next.  Once the 5-2 break is revealed, he MIGHT divine West;s shape...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: team photos: http://www.livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/2014glasgow.php|pg||
nt|scotty: East was 3rd seat, so opened 1@d as a lead directional effort on his minimum hand.  It was anti-systemic|pg||
nt|vugraphzdp: Jason has shuffled the @SK to the front of his hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzdp: England did bid 3NT on Board 27, and made, with an overtrick, so 1 IMP back|pg||
