mb|3C|nt|TopWizard:  N-S apparently don't play weak JS responses, many play that 2@h here is some variation of 5-4 M invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: for them 2@H is reverse Flannery I believe|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for East.  3NT looks like the winner this time, but difficult to find.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pelu:  EW are very close to make 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kit: The question is what shows stoppers|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Actually 3NT does go down on a diamond lead.|pg||
nt|pelu:  the problem for W is - NS has bid 2 suits - is 3@h asking og showing stopper?|pg||
nt|pelu:  many pairs would bid 3@d in East|pg||
nt|kit: Now 4@S might be a winner|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Last chance for E . .. . but mega-difficult as mentioned|pg||
nt|pelu:  so has to be played fromEast|pg||

nt|pelu:  @CK, !Â§d to A @cA and @c ruff is the besy defense|pg||
nt|kit: The key question may be which side declarer leads clubs from|pg||
nt|kit: He might reasonably play South for the short clubs and lead a club to the jack|pg||
pc|dK|nt|TopWizard:  The Norweigian Juniors are very well trained and very tough|pg||
nt|kit: He can be pretty sure the club honors are split since no club lead|pg||
nt|pelu:  why Gary - the bidding tels that S max has 3 card @h and often only 2 - so why sh S be short in @c??|pg||
nt|kit: I agree -- he should get it right -- no support redouble, so South has only 2 clubs|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Has a bit of protection with @h8 and 7 in hands|pg||
