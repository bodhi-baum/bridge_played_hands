nt|ahollan1: 4@C to show the ace [i think]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think Auken promises @C length   just lead-director|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: when i was supposedly a college student, there was a system in play called "Master System"  which used frequent 3-level preempts with 4-card suit|pg||

nt|mdgraham:  three rounds of clubs could be very awkward here. Bet S gets it right though   |pg||

nt|ahollan1: was 4N Ace Ask or  2-places to play??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and 4@C  1 ace or lowest suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: from the final contract looks like it agreed spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure  Forrester does NOT have 2-places to play -- so if not Ace Ask - could be better than immediate 5@S bid|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
mc|11|nt|mdgraham:  there's no intrinsic reason spades should be 3-1 like this - just surmising that S would have got it right - but not put to the test|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pc|d2|nt|paulg:  Three rounds of clubs may prevent an overtrick, winning the board|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: it gives declarer a guess anyway (they can ruff high and finesse) but could easily go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  unlikely to get it right after the pre-empt|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: depends whether they would expect Gold to bid 4@c on a broken 6 card suit with no side singleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  and how often Bakhshi would open 3@H on a 3631 hand with poor intermediate hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: apparently Gold/Bakhshi don't have a weak 2@h here so first seat favourable 3@h openings are often "random" - so you never know|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  but not easy to bid. N will be worried about spades |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D-2@H would have been weak|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  so the upside in the English card is all coming home and this is looking like a big win for them at the moment|pg||

nt|paulg:  excellent judgement by both NS pairs|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: he just said that having conceded 470 on the previous board he was never stopping short of 6 on this one after being raised :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham:  suggested that S could bid 5@S over the raise to 5@H - sounds good to me|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H often unbal|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in voice commentary  Peter Crouch confirmed Michaels |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW beating PAR by playing 5@CX   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close to making is 6@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems 3-1@S and 4-2@D just too tough for 12 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham:  probably double-dummy there's a way, diamonds are 4-2 and spades 3-1 so not easy|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzcu: false claim at trick two. D ruff revealed|pg||

nt|vugraphzct: depends if hes seen Zia's bids before|pg||

nt|paulg:  yes, almost always right to delay drawing trumps to establish the second suit|pg||
