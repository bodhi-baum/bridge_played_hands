mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|Minihopp:  other table bid and made 7@S|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|bt:  7@S on a heart lead is interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: no - you just duck the lead!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: It's well done to find this 7@s|pg||
nt|bt:  declarer does not see all four hands young disciple ;)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: You'd preferably want to take control as North and find out about the @dA and KQ of trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Most people won't be able to find out about the @sJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: so they will just bid it hoping things are breaking nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: -- or maybe they won't. That's the question|pg||
nt|bt:  in the closed room south transfered, asked aces and bid 5NT showing all 5 and trump queen, bidding 7 wasnt that hard for fredin|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bt:  on a heart lead you can chose to win ace, cash a club and 3 diamonds, then run trumps|pg||
nt|bt:  here you get a showup squeeze|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: you have a pretty superb hand in NOrth|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|bt:  west probably should lead a heart here given he knows about @HA in dummy|pg||
mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: it doesn't look like spades is trump any longer|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  So might stop in six knowing they don't have the @CQ?|pg||
nt|bt:  5@D over 4N is a little weird|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: if this bidding isn't more complicated than it looks like|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: could be a relay sequence of some sort of course|pg||
nt|bt:  they play 0314 so apparently clubs are trumphs|pg||
nt|bt:  down in 6@C when 7@S is making?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: if 4NT was asking for aces|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Minihopp:  So Dieden will gain some IMPs on this borad|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: according to their explanations he simply asked for aces with clubs as trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: and when partner denied the @cQ he settled for 6NT|pg||
nt|bt:  i think this very generous by team rimstedt|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: it's possible that South only has showed 5@s on the bidding |pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: but it seems unlikely|pg||
nt|bt:  suffice to say they didnt shine here|pg||
nt|bt:  the fredin magic working wonders even from the other table|pg||
nt|bt:  he used to be able to turn only the players at his table to smithereens|pg||
nt|bt:  a spade is out and a diamond is out, clubs look silly. any reason not to lead a heart, not that it matters much|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2C!|an|FG, relay|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bt:  i look in my chrystal ball and say 6NT by north|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|bt:  unless they start relaying too much again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Minihopp:  they played 6NT last time, most likely they do it again :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: that made them end up in 6NT last time :)|pg||
nt|bt:  what are the odds of a relay auction getting to the right spot?|pg||
nt|bt:  50/50?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: normally pretty good|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  well, slamstatistics are not very good from my experience, but otherwise pretty nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: not always with the right declarer however|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|bt:  one worrying thing is when one hand starts thinking after an early relay, not usually a good sign|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: I would say the slam statistics are the best ones, except from in this match|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H!|an|ShS|mb|p|nt|Minihopp:  Really Ida? I remember some slams in Polen that weren't the right ones :)|pg||
nt|bt:  sometimes having the 5NT checkback is good: How sure are you about this auction?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: The only problem is that people who knows their relays eventually uses them too much :)|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|bt:  6!nd C I dont have a clue. 6@D pretty sure. 6@H and higher "I know my stuff"|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Well, I'm counting on that you know what you're doing. Otherwise it's pretty hopeless ;)|pg||
nt|bt:  5NT - 6@C = I dont have a clue|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|bt:  so if you play a relay system, how can responding to 4@C be a problem?|pg||
nt|bt:  if you know it |pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: if 4@c is setting a trump suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: you might have to value your hand for the first time on this deal|pg||
nt|bt:  well, we will see soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: but I'm about as clueless as you|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  oh well. i did tell you this would happen|pg||
nt|bt:  nice bidding to the optimum contract|pg||
nt|bt:  and I am just trying to tease people mostly|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: Magnus doesn't want to show his explanations to me :)|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  bt that sounds like the convention "the sliding scale of awesomeness" which I met playing in China 2 years ago. Your partner open 2M weak, 2NT ASK; 3@C Now when thinking about it I don't have to my opening... ;3@D I kind of have to my opening |pg||
nt|Minihopp:  3@H I really have to my opening ;3@S Uhm partner, I actually missed a king and found out I have a 1lvl-opening ;3NT AKDxxx nothing else|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: but he was definitely perplexed about the 4NT-answer|pg||
nt|bt:  how can that be?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: apparently it shows some honours he can't have|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  that's always a bad thing :)|pg||
nt|bt:  it showed 2 aces in souths long suits, 2 queens and the higher jack|pg||
nt|bt:  i am really certain about this|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: this could get nasty|pg||
nt|bt:  i think 4@S is the normal bid here, in the closed room 3@S was a little cowardly|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: if South for some reason decided to pass|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  why did the other table play 3nt while having 9@H ?|pg||
nt|bt:  north overcalled 3NT over 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: they overcalled a standard 3NT over a 3@s-preempt|pg||
nt|bt:  and when dredin bids 3NT any of his team mates doesnt pull|pg||
nt|bt:  fredin|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  hehe|pg||
nt|bt:  maybe dreadin|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: so South decided his suit was worth as many tricks in NT|pg||

nt|bt:  he cant seriously be considering ruffing high|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: they have a pretty big buffet at the hotel so that takes some consideration|pg||
nt|bt:  though he will actually make ruffing high as well|pg||
nt|bt:  if north gets 2@S tricks, he will be forced to play a club and decl can ditch his diamond|pg||
nt|bt:  discarding his diamond now is his losing option, his only one|pg||

mb|4C|nt|vugraphzaa: finding 4@s will be difficult after this for sure..|pg||
