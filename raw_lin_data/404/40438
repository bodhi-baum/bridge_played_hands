nt|ahollan1: other table   cayne-seamon v zimmermann-multon     so i was wrong about zimm playing 1 & 3|pg||
nt|kareno: With trumps partially eliminated, declarer has some pressure on the north hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: he is up to 9|pg||
nt|barnets: by cashing club and playing h ducked|pg||
nt|barnets: then heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seamon overcalled 2@D with north hand|pg||
nt|kareno: And the outcome?|pg||
nt|kareno: So the contract went to 3nt - club lead would decimate it.|pg||
nt|kareno: I hear clubs were blocked and 3nt is making by west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seamon lead vs 3N was @C8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oy   but Cayne @C10|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfg: couldn't afford the heart 8?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: I guess the missing Heart 3 is enuough info|pg||
nt|kareno: Those interior sequences ... needed to lead the 9|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, Barnet, problem is you have teammates.  If the team concurs beforehand, yes|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: there was a brief discussion about what H-H's teammates had done in the past in similar situations.....|pg||
nt|atabey: rdbl was prepatory for the next bid I thk. but 2@d was so good for him. so he passed it out|pg||
