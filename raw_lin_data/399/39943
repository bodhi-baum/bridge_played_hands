mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|JRG:  We're getting some distributional hands. Makes it interesting...|pg||
nt|game over: South might bid a slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice time for 4@D as slam try in @C or  even preempt rkc ask|pg||
nt|ritong: a first seat 4m preempt usually does not include the A of the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i did not forsee east bidding 4@H   was just looking at south hand|pg||
nt|ritong: the reason being that, if opener has the A, 3NT remains in the picture|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Berset had 4NT in the tray, but withdrew just in time|pg||
nt|swanson:  If SOuth bids a 'normal' 5@D West may well take the push.|pg||
nt|swanson:  4@H is an overstatment of the East cards.  Double of 4@C would be more to my liking.|pg||
nt|game over: I don't think 4@c necessarily denies the @c A but it is less likely that the opener has the ace|pg||
