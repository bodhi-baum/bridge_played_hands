nt|vugraphzan: We have players from Sweden Russia Italy USA Netherlands and Lithuania|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Opening bids show six cards or good five cards.  Two level bids are string and natural (2@c = clubs)|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Simple Blackwood is the only convention (I think) - no Stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Cue and control bids are allowed ... and so are psychics|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: First round doubles are take-out, otherwise penalties|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Scoring is against a datum ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Should be starting in 2 minutes ... Zia asnswering questions about the bidding system|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Lots of specs signing in ... starting very soon ... Zia explaining system and answering questions |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Now explaining the scoring ... two board rounds ... scoring will be done every two board round|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Zia is playing ... yes indeed!|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: 25 players, so one player sitting out each round|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: They had a reserve in case only 23 players turned up ... but somehow 25 have arrived - causing a slight delay|pg||

nt|sybarra: I am still in my PJ's so I can get dressed :) |pg||
nt|ritong: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E40IFKrzDIg|pg||
nt|ritong: JJ Cale passed away recently|pg||
nt|ritong: huge character  spiritual father of clapton and knopfler, people like that|pg||
nt|sybarra: that song was sung by a country western singer in USA (not willie)  a zillion years ago |pg||
nt|sybarra: help me specs who I am thinking of |pg||
nt|ritong: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcdtbIW0m4U|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Songs written by Cale that have been covered by other musicians include "After Midnight" by Eric Clapton, Phish and Jerry Garcia, "Cocaine" by Eric Clapton, "Clyde" by Waylon ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Jennings and Dr. Hook, and "Call Me the Breeze" by Lynyrd Skynyrd, John Mayer and Bobby Bare. In 2008 he was a Grammy Award winner, jointly with Clapton.|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is super bowl sunday and also ground hog day in USA |pg||
nt|sybarra: ground hog day (not the movie) is the ground hog that predicts the length of winter |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is also first day of chinese new year (of the Horse)  maybe 2nd day |pg||
nt|sybarra: so happy new year to our chinese friends |pg||

nt|sybarra: one big weekend of parties! |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3rd day of new year,    I stand corrected |pg||
nt|odysseus69: @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: about to be back |pg||
nt|odysseus69: any news about how to find scores?|pg||
nt|sybarra: stayman not allowed? |pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland is that right? |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is goulash folks |pg||
nt|sybarra: simple blackwood |pg||
nt|sybarra: all doubles for the most part are penalty |pg||
nt|sybarra: and doubtful there will be "normal breaks" |pg||
nt|sybarra: assume you left hand opps has lots of your trumps |pg||
nt|sybarra: David can you explain the datum score in writing? |pg||
nt|odysseus69: ghoulash bidding problem- playimg with a partner who always strives to become declarer what action as dealer on the West hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: my answer = PASS|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I can do that quickly |pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The datum is the everage of the six scores at all tables, divided by 6. |pg||
nt|runnerup:  800 was available in 6 @c (x) so swing of 2500|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  So it is the average score from the six tables.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  2200|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Add up the scores and divide by six, then round off to the nearest 100|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  If you go minus 1400 and the datum is plus 140, you lose 1540 aggregate and that is not reduced by an IMP conversion in this particular event. |pg||
nt|sybarra: folks we are in a break |pg||
nt|sybarra: waiting for all players to get back |pg||
nt|odysseus69: at the Portland Club they play a ghoulash after the bidding stopsat 1 level so their players are quite used to it|pg||
nt|Henryb:  David, West might have been 0=4=9=0|pg||
nt|Henryb:  L500 is about $800|pg||
nt|sybarra: Mr Garozzo invites the players if I understand correctly |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Some discussion here about how high is a first round double for take-out?  3@d?  4@d?  ... 5@d?|pg||
nt|sybarra: entry fee  stated by Henry |pg||
nt|odysseus69: so far they havent done too well - we saw Stuart Wheeler taking a punt at 6Cx and Mr Marchessini (perhaps not typical of the standard) insists on becoming declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: or sorrry,  zia's tourney |pg||
nt|calabres: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but how wonderful to have all the great players |pg||
nt|sybarra: or fun players anyway! |pg||
nt|Henryb:  I don't disagree with you David, but I do understand why Marchessin might wand to take out insurance|pg||
nt|sybarra: think how much fun they have over dinner !  etc |pg||
nt|sybarra: they all know each other |pg||
nt|Henryb:  L50 even 30 years ago|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call them "fish"  David |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Players are moving towards their tables ... too much chatting|pg||
nt|odysseus69: new players -we just need new cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: we can tell they are probably all seeing each other and enjoying the game |pg||
nt|sybarra: discussion of Victor Mollo  in the voice,  but the comments are accurate and the stories are great |pg||
nt|odysseus69: David Barker is one of the better Portland Club players. Artur Malinowski is the manager of TGR, a fiine player who has played for England and norway.|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Can't put up the new deal while they are all walking around|pg||
nt|sybarra: for the specs,    this is goulash,   most play strong 2 bids,  NO neg. doubles,   (all penalties)    bid want you think you can make |pg||
nt|sybarra: and DO NOT rescue pard |pg||
nt|Henryb:  I suspect declarer misplayed the hand and should really have taken 7 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Phil King who started so well is an English international and James Vogl is an experienced young rubber bridge player at TGR's|pg||
