pc|dT|nt|shuster:  sometimes you make a heavy preempt and pay a price for it.  Balicki had the perfect fitter there... every honor was a cover card|pg||

nt|shuster:  (he was opposite a passed hand)|pg||
nt|wstuart: I prefer 3@H with solid @H if going to make a move.|pg||
nt|wstuart: but any tactics can be right and Adam is a fine player and knows what he's doing.|pg||
nt|shuster:  you can see that after such an accident, the vugraph commentators are still assessing blame halfway through the next board|pg||

nt|wstuart: So, is it better to be dummy after you create a bad result so you have to to think about it, or is it better to defend and be able to take your mind off it?|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't keep a private score - that helps me to get on with it without having to revisit poor results as I enter scores.|pg||

nt|wstuart: though I'm not sure what DBL by  Cezary would have meant for them.|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|d|nt|wstuart: @D slam is basically an even proposition o the @DK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rod wrote a lot about 3@h but Balicki is blocking my view. Now Meck is writing and I think it says something about short spade, but Z has tossed it on the chair and I don't know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Guess it might be minors with short @s?|pg||
nt|shuster:  In the other room, Passell Jacobus bid effectively to 5@D.  This makes 6 on the working diamond finesse.  Since 3NT can go down if the diamond is offside, there is often no need to push to slam on the finesse. |pg||
nt|shuster:  Here it seems unlikely Meckwell with wind up in NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Clearly a good hand with minors.  Perhaps they do bid crossed majors with that convention|pg||
nt|wstuart: given that 3NT and 5@D depend on the same thing, there are 2:1 IMP odds on 6@D - if you know this was the case.|pg||
nt|wstuart: *6@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The one thing I saw before Z picked up the note, read it and put it on the chair, was a spade symbol |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kareno: Perhaps a slam Garozzo wouldn't like because it's 50%.  But hard to know.  |pg||
