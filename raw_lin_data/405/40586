mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  but renee cooper has been in the tank for a very long time|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and chooses 4@h!|pg||
nt|petergill: Renee (South) is in 4@H on Bd 28|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think 12 tricks are possible here if you get @d right and hook up the @cJ|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but a pretty poor slam i think|pg||
nt|petergill: East has to avoid the @d lead for a start|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  if ou hook up the @cJ you dont actually need the @dQ|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 5Nt pick a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: to keep 6@C in the picture if a 4-4 club fit existed|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this coul dbe a critical hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: The 6@D bid should steer West to the heart lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  good lead|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Max will duck his ace when a club is led|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the victorian youth bridge newsletter is called the "Smooth Duck" which is exactly what Max will need to do when declarer pulls a @c to hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Renee Cooper is about to gain 10 imps by making 4@h on Bd 28 with good play|pg||
nt|mrdct:  careful planning going on here|pg||
nt|mrdct:  play on @d or play on @c?|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|DavidStern: So choice of club jack onside and 3-3 to make|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|DavidStern: or playing for Axx club onside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  no information, what will they lead?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nick jacob:  there's no respite for Renee today|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  she has another very tough hand to declare|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: need to hold uo the Ac on first round|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  we can all see the winning line, but it's going to be very tough|pg||
nt|DavidStern: The play in the CR was rather odd as Nick noted. Heart lead won by the ace a club to the king a diamond to dummy and then spades leaving no winning options|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Giovanni will hold up the club Ace, then Renee will have to cross to diamonds and guess the club|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  apparently the vugraph operator lost the play in the CR, David|pg||
nt|DavidStern: Ah thanks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|nick jacob:  but still hard to see what transpired|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: I think best line maybe is - win @HK, cash 4 spades pitching a heart, heart to ace, club to king|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||

nt|DavidStern: My spies tell me that Donati is a real talent and likely to hold up the club|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  yes that looks right Peter|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nick jacob:  she's just working out her pitch from dummy on the spade|pg||
nt|DavidStern: Making this would be very damaging for the Italians|pg||
pc|h3|nt|nick jacob:  if she pitches a club, she misses out on Jx of clubs in East|pg||
nt|DavidStern: If East lets go a heart declarer may play @HQ and then heart to ace|pg||
nt|DavidStern: Try to count out the hand|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  however she could be crushing west in the minors|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  hence the appeal of pitching a club, cashing two hearts and then play a club|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|DavidStern: I hope she shows good technique by playing the @C10 the first time|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  well she can get it right now, at least East can't have Axx!|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d2|pc|hA|nt|DavidStern: Money time|pg||
