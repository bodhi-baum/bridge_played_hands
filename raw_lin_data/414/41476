nt|meargent: not much  to play even marshall and  me could bring this one home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if we could help each other|pg||
nt|marlowepi: downside of Pairs broadcasts on BBO is lack of continuity from round to round. Upside is that we get to see a much wider variety of pairs in action|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and the enforced downtime while waiting for next round is good for refreshing coffee or attending to household chores, such as reading Paris Turf|pg||

nt|meargent: a revoke is always possible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: basically i think E was playing for W to have Kxxx of diamonds or so, so that he could score his third trump on a ruff. but there are two potential pro blems with that plan|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|marlowepi: declaarer's play in the trump suit made it likely that W had an honor, and if that is the king the ruff is unnnecessary|pg||

mb|1S|nt|meargent: hanlon is getting old|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well, he is vul facing a passed partner and main suit quite a ways from pret-a-porter|pg||
nt|meargent: seems pathetic to sell to 1@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 1S probably 3 spades or dead min with 4?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|meargent: crroll obviously shares my opinon|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is IMPs across the field, right? and they have spades. so any action seems at least as likely to hurt as to help|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: it seems unlikely that you can beat them at the 2 level either, and trouble could arise if partner takes your balance seriously and  competes again|pg||
