mb|1D|nt|stigw: I really dont understand Zia's bidding here. Maybe OK to open 1 nt instaed of 1 di, but to hide the good 6-carder the second round is mysterious.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sommer:  do we have 7 @S here?;)|pg||
nt|ady: should get to 6@S   or 6@D|pg||
nt|sommer:  yes, of course only 7@S for us, kibz|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|stigw: But it was a push, going down 3 vulnertable !|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to get to 7   with a key king missing|pg||

nt|ady: 5@H?|pg||

nt|stigw: It could have gone 3 down, now probably only 2 down, so a 2-digit-imp-swing to Snellers is clearly possible.|pg||
