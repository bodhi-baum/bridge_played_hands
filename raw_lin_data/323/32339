nt|vugraphzcu: :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening everybody|pg||
nt|gio 89: same contract here as in Open room|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is the last segment of the first stage of greek trials|pg||
nt|gio 89: but it seems like it should make, even with @H 4-1, given that @C are 2-2|pg||
nt|vasmar: on the spade lead since hearts break 4-1 declarer should risk to duck a club|pg||
nt|gio 89: N is a fine declarer, let's see if he gets to 12 tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: instead of playing @CA and small club|pg||
nt|gio 89: Hi vassilis, hope you don't mind if I stepped in :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: not at all thx for your comments|pg||
nt|gio 89: we didn't have a chance to see what happened in this match in the previous segment|pg||
nt|gio 89: but I think Eidi lost some of its advantage|pg||
nt|vasmar: he can play 2 runds of herat and than duck the club since hearts break 4-1|pg||
nt|vasmar: yes the difference was some 30-35 imps|pg||
nt|gio 89: so we have a closer match here now with Dionysopoulos being only -23imps|pg||
nt|vasmar: the other match is tight since Doxiadis lead by 12|pg||
nt|vasmar: i am told tht the difference reached 49 imps in last segment|pg||
nt|gio 89: it seems like almost any line works here since declarer can also go to the board with K@S if he plays A@C and club (if only he knew that @C were 2-2 :) )|pg||
nt|gio 89: yes, opponents gained back 30imps in the last 4 boards...|pg||
nt|vasmar: no they will play spade again|pg||
nt|gio 89: if they play @S again u have 12 tricks :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: and you cannot draw trumps and reach dummy to enjoy clubs|pg||
nt|gio 89: @C would be good|pg||
nt|gio 89: win in ur hand with A@S, draw trumps and play A@C and @C... over :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|gio 89: but as I said already, he doesn't know that @C are 2-2 so he needs much more time than us :)|pg||

nt|gio 89: yes|pg||
nt|gio 89: but without cashing the heart, crucial|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|gio 89: he cashed it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|gio 89: now even a switch would be too late|pg||
nt|alati: the question is what they lead from J98xx|pg||
nt|vasmar: +1|pg||
nt|vasmar: 11 imps probably|pg||
nt|gio 89: yes, maybe would have been better for W to duck the @S so to allow E to signal over the next @S trick|pg||
mc|10|nt|vasmar: good point|pg||

nt|mgarouf: eliminated for good|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|mgarouf: 2@H would be a good idea from E but the vulnerability and the current score are not in favour |pg||
nt|mgarouf: anyway E/W will collect 8 easy tricks for 100 points|pg||
nt|mgarouf: no difference|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|mgarouf: any strange idea from W to underlead an ace will cost 1 trick|pg||
nt|mgarouf: board  17 in CR, S ducked a club and made his slam in @H|pg||
nt|mgarouf: sorry N did|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: after finding out that trumps dont behave was compulsory, but good line|pg||
