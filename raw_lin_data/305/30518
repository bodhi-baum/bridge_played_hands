pc|d7|pc|dT|mc|10|nt|dburn:  the players have rattled through these - official time for 16 boards is 140 minutes, but this set has barely taken 90|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: last board here|pg||
nt|vugraphzch: thanks all for watching|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|pef: finally, what should be a heavily contested auction|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|pef: north south canmake 5 diamonds despite the 4-0 split with a bit of care|pg||
mb|p|nt|suokko:  Second double would look like a balanced hand|pg||
nt|pef: east west can make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|pef: and north might actually pass here|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: certainly thinking about it|pg||
nt|suokko:  It would have been better to enter biding with minor two suiter and then show strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: wow, we are ending on a bang|pg||

pc|c9|nt|pef: I like 2n over 1n a lot better and even 4n over 3h instead of double, but I think north should bid 4d.  as they say, t/o doubles are meant to be taken out|pg||

nt|pef: other table they are in 5 diamonds, so should be a two way game swing.  england will be in the lead by about 9 or 10 imps after this board|pg||
nt|pef: ah missed by one, 11 imps|pg||
nt|pef: rare you can double your imp total for a segment on the final board|pg||

nt|dburn:  not that the play has been poor - there have been some hard-fought deals - but this was not the world's most exciting collection|pg||
mb|p|nt|junior: some distribution!|pg||
nt|dburn:  but maybe here is something|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2D|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|junior: E/W make 4@h, and n/s make 5@d on careful play|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn:  well, East-West at the other table are in 3@h doubled|pg||
nt|junior: so par is for E/W to save in 5@h doubled|pg||
mb|5D|nt|junior: yikes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|dburn:  which sounds as though someone doubled something for takeout and her partner did not see it that way|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|junior: I'd say that 5@d is a "normal" result, but one interesting aspect of IMP scoring is that it often pays to buy the contract in both rooms when the deal is well-fitting|pg||

nt|junior: Let's say that one team over-competed, playing 6@d in one room and 5@h in the other|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s3|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|junior: they would lose 4-6 IMPs for the two small minus scores|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn:  so if Dhondy can bring home 5@d, and I don't see why she should not, the swing will be about 14 IMPs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
mc|11|nt|junior: and sometimes when you make in both rooms, the swing is enormous|pg||
nt|junior: so a big finish to England|pg||
nt|junior: who leads by 11 with 64 boards to play|pg||
