mb|1D|nt|yorkbeach:  thanks David and thanks for watching|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yorkbeach:  still plenty of action to come at other tables|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:  in BB, Italy have already built up quite a lead over Monaco|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|yorkbeach:  the other table in this match will be playing for a while yet|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ady: with diamonds coming in for 6 tricks it takes a heart lead to defeat a alsm|pg||
nt|ady: slam|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS have gone past 3NT but 5@d should be OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unless the slam is in clubs    then doomed|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  will be natural to play the partner of the pre-emptor for the @dQ|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hard for West to find a @h lead against 5@c|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  6@c will be easier to beat|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: bad result for USA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  even 5@c could fail if West somehow leads a @h|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s2|nt|yorkbeach:  North might have bid something other than 5@c with a better hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  South knew that either the @sKQ was facing a singleton or that EW had a ruff coming|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so a bad holding either way|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
