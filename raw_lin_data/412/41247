nt|shuster:  and of course 4@S, as the specs are quick to point out to me|pg||
mc|9|nt|shuster:  You'd usually make 5@C, as a spade lead is very unlikely|pg||
nt|sommer:  @S9 lead and duck from W sets 5@C|pg||
nt|shuster:  I just don't see the @SAQ6 leading a low spade|pg||
nt|sommer:  no, it's good in S|pg||

nt|shuster:  there was a ruling in the second segment that is swinging 11 imps to USA2, so the score shown is incorrect|pg||
nt|shuster:  I'm just as surprised he passed 4@H as him passing 2@H|pg||
