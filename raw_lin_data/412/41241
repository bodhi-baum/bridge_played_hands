mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|Chick: Looks like a natural 3N contract here that goes down 1 on spade lead and heart finesse offside|pg||
mb|p|nt|Chick: so probably a push board|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|zaXXon: ...and South will definitely lead top club|pg||
nt|Chick: true, but a club lead still won't give them a 9th trick|pg||

nt|warrens:  if they lead a top @c and declarer wins the Ace, doesn't he take the @h finesse and claim on 3-3 @d's?|pg||

nt|Chick: what can Hurd do to get him to go wrong on that?|pg||
nt|zaXXon: Hurd may decide this for him with a @s return|pg||
nt|warrens:  he will have to decide which way to go since his communication isn't very good|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|warrens:  but if he decides to try @d's, there's always the chance that N has 4 and gets endplayed anyway|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
