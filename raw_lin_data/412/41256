nt|kit: Even if he leads a small heart, looks like down 2.|pg||
nt|Chick: yeah, short one entry to pick up the entire club suit|pg||
nt|kit: everybody saying makes with small heart lead.  Remember, declarer can't see all 4 hands.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|4D!|nt|stigw: Even my late mother would have made 12 or 13 tricks East/West on the previous |pg||

pc|h9|nt|sommer:  ..and E got only 8 tricks in b13 |pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, big swing for USA on board 13, where West had better to leave it 5 cl x. The real swing was created here at this table, however, through the cheap sacrifice in 4 sp only 1 ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|kit: This is a 5 or 7 hand -- diamonds split make 7.  Diamonds don't split, make only 5|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|warrens:  South can like his hand too much with no red values|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kit: I do not understand the reason for this 4@C call.  Why bring partner into the picture when you know what to do yourself?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  can't|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: I think he should have just bid grand slam force right away (or exclusion).  It is silly to put partner under pressure like this.|pg||
nt|warrens:  what would you bid Kit,|pg||
nt|kit: either 5NT if GSF, or 5@C if exclusion|pg||
nt|warrens:  got it. I think 5NT is reasonable|pg||
