mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2S|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  E will probably pass this, but W may have more to say.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham:  Looks like 4@D=natural fit-jump, with spade support|pg||

nt|mdgraham:  and may well bid on on the basis that if you have a big double-fit, play the hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  just in case one contract is making, one way or the other|pg||
