mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: any feelings about east passed hand  using DBL vs 1N?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Nickell Team is already qualified as USA1 and is happily home, ready for the World's|pg||
mb|3D|nt|krhorneman:  at this vulnerability, I think 1NT better|pg||
nt|krhorneman:  you want to show better distribution and stronger desire to compete|pg||
nt|3for3:  Â­3nt is also cold, but not easy to bid|pg||
nt|3for3:  cold as the cards lay, of course|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  E-W can make 4@c but 4@d is the Par Contract|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Sorry, 3@c|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  3NT can't be found, S has no idea the strength of N's @d support|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: many players during the week reshuffle their cards during thought, Berkowitz now for example|pg||
nt|krhorneman:  East would be better positioned here if he had bid 1NT, I think|pg||
mb|3S|nt|krhorneman:  he would know pard will compete when appropriate, having already shown 55|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|3for3:  East using his PH status to show the 5th spade.   Normally double followed by a new suit shows a BIG hand|pg||
