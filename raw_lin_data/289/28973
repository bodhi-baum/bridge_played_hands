nt|KingCur: on  12, declarer in other oom got a club lead|pg||
nt|KingCur: room*|pg||
nt|HedyG: the Austrian lady in the other room led a small @c last hand which i find reasonable since S more or less denied majors and you risk leading a major into declarers suit then|pg||
nt|KingCur: specs inquiring if there is a carry over in this final..is there, operator?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|HedyG: Roberto Carlos is our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: They said at the table that there isnt any carry-over.|pg||
nt|HedyG: ok ty Roberto!|pg||
nt|KingCur: 4@C not the convention whose name shall not be mentioned but Texas trsf, indicating S wishes to play either 4@H or ask aces for that suit (bidding 4NT after that)|pg||
mb|d|nt|KingCur: it's a handy agreement that allows you to have 1NT-2@D-2@H-4NT to be quantitative|pg||
nt|HedyG: 4@c is a weaker bid than transferring via 2@D and then bidding 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|KingCur: and, as Hedy said, to let a raise to 4 via 2-level trsf be a mild slam invite|pg||
nt|HedyG: Mike Graham suggesting a free 4@D bid by N here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||

nt|djneill:  also, @h likely 3-2 now - if South had 1, would have rebid something, if South had 4, would have opened 1@h|pg||

nt|djneill:  could draw trumps and low club but what if South ducks :-)|pg||
