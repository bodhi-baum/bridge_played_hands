nt|jonottawa: I take online scores with a grain of salt without specific info|pg||
nt|glen: there was a 21.8 imp penalty for slow play on L'Ecuyer|pg||
nt|jonottawa: which I'm sure Noodle will provide us with if he hasn't already|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: penalty has been reduced to 15.8  |pg||

nt|vugraphzbm: so l ecuyer 6+|pg||
nt|jonottawa: I really don't mind that if it was calculated fairly|pg||

nt|glen: the Miles team fined 6, or Huang fined 6?|pg||
nt|jonottawa: if I'm L'Ecuyer I fight to even the 'bridge' result or at least to go out on a high note, but it might be really swingy, we'll see|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: score as stands now 193/245|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: miles team fined 6  represented by Huang|pg||

nt|vugraphzbm: i was here late on all sets yesterday involving ZM NL|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: then they had a team meeting  thinking of withdrawing|pg||
nt|jonottawa: so the bidding misunderstanding sent 11 IMPs L'Ecuyer's way|pg||
nt|glen: due to the hockey game tonight, we are giving a beer to the first player who ducks a blackhook|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: but they decided to duke it out  tks|pg||
nt|jonottawa: only 6 more boards like that and we have a new leader|pg||

nt|glen: against 3NT here, if the D starts with a @S, ducked, then not much chance of making|pg||
nt|glen: so swing possible|pg||
nt|glen: the interesting thing about the last board, is if you play "normal" bridge (say you preempt 4@H), you might get a swing just by EW stopping in 4@S|pg||
nt|jonottawa: unlikely but indeed your analysis is correct, all depends on whether S gets to get a bid in or not|pg||
