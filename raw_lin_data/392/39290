nt|glen: I like 2@S here, he denied 3@Ss already|pg||
nt|zind:  tends to deny it seems|pg||

nt|vugraphzbm: insufficient 2@C AND 2@H HERE|pg||
nt|zind:  i am guessing|pg||
nt|glen: oh, well with the tends, I would bid 3@C|pg||
nt|glen: pardon normand|pg||
nt|jonottawa: so the auction is borked|pg||
nt|glen: who bid 2@C|pg||
nt|jonottawa: because of insufficient bids|pg||
nt|jonottawa: presumably s|pg||
nt|glen: type out the auction normand|pg||
nt|jonottawa: and then jeff bid 2h|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: 2@c by lindop 2@h by smith|pg||
nt|glen: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: I think not allowed with screens under conditions of contests but I m not running to get a director|pg||
nt|glen: so it has gone 1@C-Pass-1@S-2@H-2@C-2@H-?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: yes|pg||
nt|glen: now did N double W's 2@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: not yet :) I ll kepp you posted|pg||
nt|glen: I think that W's 2@H accepts the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: 2@h by Jeff was alerted by Miles :)  thay must have an agreement|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: under CoC any inmsfficeient bid is cancelled|pg||
mb|3C|nt|glen: for some reason I understand that word|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5C|nt|zind:  i guess he is considering whether N is 4252|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbm: C o C  = conditions of contest|pg||
nt|jonottawa: another game that would be fairly simple with 2-2 trumps that will probably go down|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: please note that 3@C and 3@h were in fact 2@c and 2@h|pg||
nt|zind:  im not sure it will go down on a H lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|zind:  cant he set up the long spade then pitch a diamond on the 5th spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: Lindop asking for agreement on 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: Smith confirms law level|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: so bad hand with 3@hs|pg||
nt|zind:  he can compress the diamond and club loser i think|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|glen: and he could get @Cs right|pg||
nt|zind:  doesnt seem very double dummy either|pg||
nt|jonottawa: I didn't mean to imply it had no play, just was predicting the result, indeed it's cold double dummy if declarer guesses everything|pg||
nt|glen: E is not thrilled with switching here (picture S with @D J), might continue high @H|pg||
nt|zind:  i know, i am just saying if it goes club club, and he gets the bad news, what line does he really have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbm: this bridge week generated many good stories   Hope I ll have time to share a few on bridge winners|pg||
nt|jonottawa: I think you're right, he doesn't have to guess nearly everything and can still make it|pg||
nt|jonottawa: we'll see if he does, I hope he does, keep the match close|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbk: 4C how many controls a=2 K =1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  5@H would have been an odd call, as normally a sign off... but could pass 4@H for that|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: 4H  2 controls|pg||
nt|shuster:  6@H is a fair contract, East presumably knew Wests shape and control count|pg||
nt|shuster:  1@S showed hearts and an unbalanced hand. 2@C showed clubs, 2NT longer clubs, 3@D showed shortness in diamonds and 3@S... 3415 specifically, at least if my secret decoder ring is working properly|pg||
nt|shuster:  6@H is a fair contract.  If the clubs come home, he has 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shuster:  1@S also showed positive values, so West would either have the @HA and some scattered Q's or the black kings and at least 1 queen.  The black Kings offer better play for the slam|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|shuster:  declarer can strip the pointed suits before playing on clubs|pg||
nt|shuster:  so even if he misguesses, North will be endplayed into giving a ruff and discard for the contract|pg||
nt|shuster:  he is working out the safest way to time this manuever|pg||
nt|shuster:  one way to require less trumping things is to discard dummy's spade on the @DK so no spade ruff is needed. |pg||

nt|TopWizard:  P of 1@s X?|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Wow, a 6-6!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: some tension re time left over and the director was hovering|pg||

mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  E might have bid higher :)|pg||

nt|shuster:  perhaps expecting North with a half spade stopper to come back 3@S.  Still sometimes you are 3-3 in spades and then 3NT is your only chance|pg||
