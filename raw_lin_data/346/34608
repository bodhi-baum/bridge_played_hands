nt|shuster:  If the @D2 was 4th best, then that is probably not best.  If attitude, then it is better.|pg||
nt|shuster:  When a defender leads fouth best from a four card suit against 3NT, they very seldom have a singleton on the side|pg||
nt|shuster:  If Lu shifts toa spade here and declarer splits dummy's 10/9, South must withhold her Queen to beat the contract|pg||
nt|shuster:  leaving both black suits blocked|pg||
nt|shuster:  Another problem with the club avoidance play is that declarer really would like to win six club tricks, since there is no ready ninth trick she can rely on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lu is thinking what to play|pg||
nt|shuster:  North can be pretty sure declarer has the @DJ, or the play in clubs doesn't make a lot of sense|pg||
nt|shuster:  So she could play for it to be doubleton and lay down the Queen|pg||
nt|shuster:  or she can chance a shift|pg||

nt|ritong: fascinating hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The director has been called because of something - I do not know what - I  think it has to do with the quesion declarer asked - I think it may have been about how many diamonds N ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: had for the DBL of 1@d|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  yes.....declarer did nothing wrong, just did not pick off the doubleton K.........|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: N wrote "usually she doesn't have 4 hearts or 4 spades" (about the pass after RDBL)|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  On board 44, the 4-0 heart break caused a 28 IMP swing.........|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  I think E wants to go back and double 2 clubs, easier........|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: So declarer was convinced that S had 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: N says that when her partner led the club 8, she closed the screen and pointed to the "usually" on the note, because from the high club lead she knew her partner did have a 4 card ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Major.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: East explains that she thought S had to be 3352 when she had no 4 card Major and only 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  I do not think that EW will get an adjustment here.......because S usually would not have a 4 card major, does not mean she always does not have one....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  Could end up as a late nite Las Vegas committee..........|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: N says "I wouldnt bid 2@c if I thought she might have a 4 card Major"|pg||
