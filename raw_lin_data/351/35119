nt|ahollan1: what's best line on assumption that WEST has @HKxxx|pg||
nt|kit: He can count on picking up 4 diamond tricks from the bidding, so aiming for 4 diamonds, 4 hearts, and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: Probably simply playing ace and a small heart (assuming nothing exciting happens) is best -- that seems to always make as far as I can see|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tias:  A special kind of stayman that I think was invented by Johan Upmark, but Im not sure|pg||
nt|tias:  they bid 2nt or 3@c with both majors|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Mbodell:  CC for 2@C from N is (10)11-15(16) so I can understand N not deciding to open this 10 count with a terrible suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i thought passed hand would respond 1@S :(|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: at this rate, maybe they will reach 4@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: positive response by passed hand shows 4+ zz     where A=3 K=2 Q=1   [stiff K/Q deducts one point]|pg||
nt|Mbodell:  1@H shows 5+ AKQ points and <5 @H|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well   unpassed hand   1@H would show  NO SHORTNESS and not 5+@H|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Mbodell:  The 5+ is UPH, so 4+ by PH may well be right.  The AKQ points are also zz points or relay points where A=3;K=2;Q=1|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: So South has bid his singleton and his doubleton, North his tripleton and his singleton.  All makes sense.|pg||

mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|bt:  a 4th trump would be nice though|pg||
nt|bt:  3@H makes sense now!?|pg||
nt|bt:  3@D should be some sort of slam try|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bt:  so 3@H then 4@D then nothing more, would make sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|tias:  some pairs play two-way drury with 2@c showing 3-card supp and 2@d showing 4+supp|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|jkdood: West in other room found a creative 3@D bid over 3@C after somewhat similar start;  worked well|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|kit: Wow -- yet another slam for E-W|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|scotty: For the record, North having @ckQx is about 11%, and either player having Kxxx with a singleton club is a bit over 20% |pg||
nt|kit: This one looks pretty easy -- they have so much power and East has the source of ticks|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 100% game force     so 3@C not as dangerous as some might think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for those who play 2minor then immediate rebid of 3minor is NF   east rebid is problematic|pg||
nt|kit: Of course that singleton club might be a small club -- but it does look like the straightforward line is best -- maybe ruff 1 heart first to see if Kx drops|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  If you play old fashion 1S-3C would be fine :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmmm   i was going to ask if you prefer  3@H or 4@C over 3@C|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW play a form of Bergen Raises -- which does NOT include strong jump shift|pg||
mb|4D|nt|scotty: From West's viewpoint, it might be that 3N is the best game, with partner having @dxxx.  But I don't see a sensible auction to reach that, so (again), I'd recommend setting trump ...|pg||
nt|scotty: with 4@c - though this time I think 3 of a red suit is reasonable, and might elicit a 31s preference.  3@s I'm not so sure about - what happens if partner raises to 4@s?  I guess ...|pg||
nt|scotty: he was going to pass...   |pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kit: 6@C reached on previoous board at other table|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ahollan1:  11  Gronkvist in 6@C awaiting the opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|scotty: thinking of 6N, maybe|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: If East had a heart less and a @d more, you'd rather be in 6@c...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1:  11  6@C on @D lead    Ida Gronkvist immediately played @C to Ace|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|tias:  2nt = singlesuited|pg||

nt|bt:  there are hands on which relaying is good, this isnt necessarily one of them|pg||
nt|tias:  2nt = singlesuited with extra values|pg||
nt|bt:  west having huge extras and east some extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|bt:  if west bids 3NT as a relay response, east might pass|pg||
nt|tias:  I think GrÃ¶nkvist has set @s as trumps now and asking for shortness, but a kib might help me here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|bt:  spades? that might not be optimal|pg||

mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't most defenses focus on just the majors?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: with some using 4@C to say unequal length in majors  and  4@D  equal length|pg||
