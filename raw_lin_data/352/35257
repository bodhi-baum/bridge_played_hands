nt|bobh1: in pairs, barometer scoring makes it more exciting but also opens the door to some unfortunate situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on the flip side of barometer --  it is an amazing talent to be able to predict your standing in a field|pg||
nt|jbgood:  brb|pg||
nt|ahollan1: best story for me --  i watched Barry Crane guesstimate a 460 on 325 average   [with Peter Rank they actually scored 463]|pg||
nt|bobh1: in a ko, knowing what you need to win on the last board of a match makes for some very exciting last boards|pg||
nt|bobh1: but we seem to get them a lot these days even without barometer scoring|pg||
nt|bobh1: and of course if the match isn't close, barometer makes no difference at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both sessions  22 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 boards against each other finalist|pg||
nt|bobh1: hand is over|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ladies  only 10 pairs in each group, so different number of boards, so different set of hands|pg||

nt|ahollan1: voice commentary mentioning that only 3 american flags in use during this event|pg||

nt|bobh1: Castner--is he a movie star?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he shows up all of the time now in Honor Roll for Bridge World Master Solvers' Club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when I knew him, Kevin was a Financial guy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland saying that Castern won recent TGR Pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct me if I'm wrong   TGR = The Great Rose   [Irving]|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think TGR is a London bridge club|pg||
