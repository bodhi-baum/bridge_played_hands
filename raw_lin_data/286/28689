pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|debrose: 2N showed 22-24, perhaps even good 22.  Willenken with his great controls, recognized slam likely if partner had a club fit|pg||
nt|debrose: So even though he'd already upgraded his 21, he tried|pg||
nt|debrose: knowing that in his partnership he still had the option, which most experts don't, of stopping in 5N|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|nt|debrose: For some reason most top players never, or virtually never, bid 5N to play.  Michael and I are both big believers in doing so.  Why not try to be as accurate as possible in these ...|pg||
nt|debrose: decision?|pg||
nt|debrose: Of course you need to have well defined when 5N is a pick a slam, and when it's an invitation to six (or "nothing more to say" as it was here)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|debrose: Michael and I play that 5N directly over any NT bid is a stronger invitation than 4N would be|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|debrose: And that over a quantitative 4N, 5N directly is always invitational - there are plently of natural bids available with "pick a slam|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|s4|pg||

mb|5D|nt|kit: and might not make anyway -- have to get the diamonds right|pg||

nt|barnets: and they are still bidding on and up|pg||
nt|kit: Bathurst meant 4NT as natural, Dwyer took it as minors I think.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bathurst thinks Dwyer has accepted the invitational 4NT and is showing 4+ diamonds.   Not sure about Dwyer.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why natural  if 2N = forcing?|pg||

nt|barnets: @SJ lead|pg||
nt|kit: The most unpopular contract of all.|pg||
nt|kit: But in other room no overcall, so don't know about the spade situation -- so might misjudge the play.|pg||
nt|barnets: @SJ was ducked to the K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Bathurst thinking 5N asks Kings  must be in panic now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why is he having trouble responding??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Willenken opened strong 2@C|pg||
nt|Drewsky: Because he doesnt think it a backwood auction|pg||
nt|Drewsky: blackwood*|pg||
nt|Drewsky: He might have thought that 4NT was minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no  i'm saying Bathurst worrying if he thinks 4N/5N blackwood but no realizing Dwyer on different page|pg||
nt|kit: clearly he did think that, considering the 5@D call.|pg||

nt|Drewsky: There you have it folks..the BEST players in America play in 5NT at both tables|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bathurst:  "anyway, good pass"|pg||
