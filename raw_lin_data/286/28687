mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kareno: Responsive double of course and south bids his spade suit, headed for game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|kareno: This hand should not present problems.  Spades reasonable and so are clubs.|pg||
nt|phil: some work in 4@s - a trump would have been more effective|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|phil: the layout of the heart suit could not be friendlier, which could have been used as a fallback had a trump been led I think|pg||
nt|kareno: On a trump shift, with the club jack offside, he'll need one more trick.  Singleton trump is unappealing, though.|pg||
nt|phil: right, single trumps are generally a no-no|pg||
nt|phil: but Steve does have a heart stack so, ....|pg||
nt|kareno: The late Lew Mathe forbade (on pain of being kicked off the team) any singleton trump lead|pg||
nt|phil: he didn't like trump leads as a rule anyway, right? |pg||
nt|kareno: I think not.  Too passive|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|phil: curious why Katz/Nickell didn't compete over 1N in the other room, assuming double would have been responsive? |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know if they play it that way.  I wouldn't be passing in that auction but vulnerable, Katz had concerns|pg||
nt|phil: good auction to discuss with your partners - is (1x) - 1y - (1N) - dbl - responsive? or just cards? |pg||
nt|kareno: Trump again and now Hampson will be at the node point of the hand.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kareno: Hampson knows east's opening bid by now and with a heart honor it would have fallen into strong notrump territory... so hearts are becoming marked with west|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|phil: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|phil: and he only needs to establish one heart trick anyway for a @d pitch|pg||
nt|phil: so as long as the @cJ or @h9 falls, he has 10|pg||
nt|kareno: But a club finesse is still possible.  He would need to play the heart now.|pg||
nt|phil: AK + A is an opener - so has to work out if Levin is 3=4=4=2 or 3=3=4=3|pg||
nt|kareno: Lurking in his mind, too is the holding of KJTx in diamonds in west and a heart honor in east.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's so much easier when you see all the hands.  |pg||
nt|phil: too true|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kareno: That was unfortunate for Hampson - a perfectly reasonable play|pg||
nt|phil: someone mentioned Weinstein wouldn't discard a heart from honor or HH-4th of hearts - seems like a valid assumption|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade or diamond now defeats it.|pg||
