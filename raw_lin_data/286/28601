mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dank: Gavin's clever spade falsecard lulled Weinstein into thinking spades were breaking so he made only 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|dank: Gavin will need to guess the heart suit here to make 4@H|pg||
nt|cherilou: hard to do--W could easily have sigleton|pg||
nt|dank: the percentage play in a vacuum is to take a finesse against the @HQ, but with RHO showing much more strength than LHO Gavin may rise @HK|pg||
nt|cherilou: singleton|pg||
nt|dank: certainly, he may feel that his counterpart may rise @HK hoping for a swing, and he may do so as well to try to have a flat board|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|dank: typically if you are not an experienced "counter-swinger" you should just take the percentage action on a board, but if you believe you know how your opponent will try to generate ...|pg||
nt|dank: a swing, you can try to counter it|pg||
nt|dank: Just another of the poker-style elements of bridge|pg||
nt|cherilou: or reverse psychology|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dank: here's the moment of truth for Gavin. Incidentally, Steve Weinstein has been a poker mentor to Gavin in the past. so there is really a lot of history between these two|pg||
nt|dank: Gavin is trying to decide why Weinstein played this card: is he trying to bamboozle Gavin with @HAQ2? Or is he playing a deep game with @HA2 or (much less likely) @HQ2?|pg||

nt|cherilou: N has to underlead his @H's here but remember S hid XX and where are his cards?|pg||
nt|dank: John may place the @HK in Gavin's hand due to a) the redouble, and b) the failure to play a heart through when he had the chance|pg||
