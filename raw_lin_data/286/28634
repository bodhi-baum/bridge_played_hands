mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Hi Scott|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So, six teams left for two positions|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzff: This is interersting psychologically. Nickell just lost a long 2 day match in which they trailed the entire time. Gordon has won two in a row|pg||
mb|1N|nt|prospero1:  In the USA1 final, we'll see if Kranyak can continue their magic|pg||
nt|medwards: With a four man team|pg||
nt|prospero1:  In the other USA2 quarterfinal, an interesting matchup that has Diamond, playing four-handed, facing their former teammates, Moss and Gitelman|pg||
mb|2S|nt|medwards: Bridge incest|pg||
nt|prospero1:  If any of the four-men teams qualify, they will need to choose another pair to accompany them to Bali|pg||
nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Meckstroth takes the low road, only raising to 2@s in deference to the 1N bid on his right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: This match has Meckstroth-Rodwell facing their GNT teammate, d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: David Berkowitz|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|prospero1:  As I understand it, a qualifying four-man team can choose their third pair, subject to USBF approval|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: they must choose a third pair|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Normally this would not be a Rusinow situation (lower of touching honors) for Rodwell, so @cK then @cA shows a doubleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Pratap certainly bought well|pg||
nt|medwards: If Kran wins, will they go old or new?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c3|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Best shot by Rodwell, but unfortunately Meckstroth does not have an entry|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So the winner of the two-day match between Kranyak and Fleisher will be USA 1|pg||
nt|prospero1:  The four teams still alive in USA 2 will come down to one over the next two days|pg||
nt|prospero1:  They will then play the loser of Kranyak and Fleisher for USA2|pg||
nt|medwards: This is a good format|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and have the chance to lose twice in represent your country matches, as has happened a couple times before|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Mike, I have no idea who Kranyak would pick, but it would be an interesting choice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: because life isn't agonizing enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Rod apologizes, everyone sips coffee|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I believe the Diamond team had the experience of losing the USA1 and USA2 finals a couple of years ago|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, Pratap has tea it appears. Gordon is drinkless, but is resting his hands contentedly on his stomach as he leans back|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Ekeblad has done it|pg||

nt|prospero1:  At a higher level there are those who finished second in the Bermuda Bowl multiple times without winning|pg||
mb|1D|nt|prospero1:  The most famous example is Norman Kay, perhaps the greatest player never to win a world championship|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  I was teased the other day when I referred to a three-card raise in this situation as "old-fashioned"|pg||

mb|p|nt|prospero1:  It would not only be old-fashioned, but downright conservative|pg||
nt|prospero1:  3@c is perhaps their weak bid, also denies five spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: maybe I need to come in early and vg a few hands to loosen up|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Mr. Kay was a great gentleman|pg||

mb|3D|nt|prospero1:  Once I stayed with them in Philadelphia when playing at a nearby sectional|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  The idea is to ask for aces in a way that doesn't get you past your last making spot if partner has the wrong number|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Since 4N works so well for spades, you bid one over the agreed trump suit to ask for aces|pg||

nt|prospero1:  @SKx|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So Katz and Nickell did play a game on board 2, just the wrong one as they tried their 43 spade fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Meckwell just realized they had a 6@S save|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I was also wrong that a trump lead would beat 5@d on  2 ... declarer still has 11 tricks through 5 diamonds, two hearts, three spades, and one heart ruff|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Vugraphzff: general website for this event is www.usbf.org|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  So, it may be a little tricky to get to spades when it will be the third or fourth suit bid|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Pratap's line of not ruffing high was better, because it catered to Meckstroth holding all five outstanding spades|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  With so much of his hand in the round suits, Pratap should not get too excited here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: West's first time to play a hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|prospero1:  Pratap has played nine!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he's wearing his hand hog shoes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dbl me:  ...and no doubt looking forward to the tenth|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Meckstroth leads a trump, knowing Gordon will need to set up diamonds|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|prospero1:  There is a lot of debate about whether the correct rebid with the E hand after 1@h-2@d is 2@h, 2N, or 3@c|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|d9|pg||
nt|dbl me:  For developing players...if you get a trump lead, don't assume that your side suit will split mercifully.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  No choice is optimal, and much of what these pairs do is set by what they have agreed, not their judgment at the table|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: likely get started fairly promptly|pg||
nt|prospero1:  The problem with rebidding 2@h to punt, is that on a lot of hands it is quite valuable for responder to know if opener has a sixth heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  The problem with bidding 3@c is that it takes up a lot of room|pg||
mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Yes, that controversy may never be settled.|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  The problem with 2N as a punt is that responder likes to know if he can count on at least two trumps from opener|pg||
mb|1H|nt|prospero1:  1@d here 10-15, 2+ diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  This auction is not uncommon|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Rodwell doesn't need a club stopper to bid 1N|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Of course, he has a pretty good one here|pg||
nt|dbl me:  A few pairs now play that a 2N rebid artificially shows 6+ in the major!|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I can see a certain sense to that agreement ... it keeps the auction low when you have to explore more|pg||
nt|dbl me:  right|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Gordon, or any West, has no idea what to lead against this precision auction|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I might try a spade, although that works badly here|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Low heart works best, but you would like better spots when hearts have been bid on your right|pg||
nt|prospero1:  either minor is a shot in the dark|pg||
nt|dbl me:  The best defense vs. 1N is to bid 2C.  ;-)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  The only upside of having to make this lead is that getting it wrong will not cost you a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Katz tried the @d3 on the same auction|pg||
nt|dbl me:  always tough to lead a suit bid honestly on your R|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, i had to run to restroom|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: to return to find out all of 1 trick has been played|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Good choice ... why I'm not in this event|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Always can fall back on "fourth from longest and strongest"|pg||
nt|dbl me:  We look forward to kibitzing you next time though.  ;-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  From Pratap's side, he can start clubs|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzff: sorry, got auction wrong|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sixela: now eric must unblock h|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I don't think Rodwell will make nine tricks on this start, so the match will get closer at the break|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|sixela: i think rodwell may well go down now|pg||
nt|dbl me:  He may well conclude that the 10 was very likely to be honest...|pg||
nt|prospero1:  No entry to long club, but this keeps Rodwell from keeping a late entry to cash the @hQ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Well, he won't be making this|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|prospero1:  If he flies @cK, he maintains the capacity to play on spades|pg||
nt|sixela: reason why he had to unblock the A|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Gordon will be happy with this start however many it is|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Now he's shut out of his hand, but EW can't play on majors without giving him access or setting up tricks in the dummy|pg||
nt|dbl me:  It wd not be presumptuous to speculate that Eric is not delighted with himself on this particular hand.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  1N hands are fascinating ... so many variations|pg||
nt|dbl me:  agree 100%|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: next set's lineups will be Katz-Nickell and Levin-Weinstein vs Gordon-Pratap and Pepsi-Seamon if form holds|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Gordon and Pratap have put up a top notch defense so far|pg||
nt|dbl me:  hard to believe that they used to throw NV 1n's in at the rubber bridge club|pg||
nt|prospero1:  They just don't have the firepower to beat it, so they'll have to settle for a one or two IMP gain|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I'm marvelling at Meckstroth's judgment on 12 to defend 3@d|pg||
