nt|Minihopp:  Hello all and welcome back to the 2nd out of 6th segments :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbk: sweden c.o is 38.5 |pg||
nt|tias:  so Sweden still in front here, but not by plenty|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Voice commentary bottom of screen :)|pg||
nt|tias:  Sweden had 4,5imps carryover|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  EW playing a fairly natural 5533-system with 2/1 GF|pg||
nt|tias:  and the score is now 38,5-38 in favour of Sweden|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  NS playing 5542 with transferresponses after 1@C|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  here you can see player profiles, teams, CCs:  http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/2014istanbul.php|pg||
nt|bebechira: ok Mikael profile is OK now|pg||
nt|tias:  And NS also play a lot of game forcing relay sequences|pg||

nt|tias:  Lets have a party here!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bebechira: this is Matias http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=13963|pg||
nt|tias:  dbl most likely showing both majors|pg||
nt|tias:  since 1@h is natural|pg||
nt|tias:  Im guessing|pg||
nt|tias:  EW must stop in a part score somehow|pg||
nt|tias:  Rosenberg has a nice hand I must say|pg||
nt|tias:  but K stiff in @h will be devaluated now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: Looks like they will stop in 3@C, unless 2@H is game-forcing|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tias:  you might be right, Kit|pg||
mb|p|nt|tias:  maybe a @s contract now?|pg||
nt|kit: AKQ10xx is called trumps|pg||
nt|tias:  EW playing in 3@c in CR|pg||
nt|bebechira: Kit Woolsey http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=4210|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bebechira: and this is Erika Rodin http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=30686|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  Might end up to high now|pg||
nt|kit: But East thought 2@H was game-forcing.  An important understanding for a partnership to have.|pg||
nt|tias:  ooohh looking good there Erika|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tias:  I wouldnt blame Rosenberg for gameforcing with his hand|pg||
nt|kit: I would|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: Why not a simple 3@C -- if East passes, there won't be a game.|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  I guess it all depends on the limit for the X|pg||
nt|tias:  but maybe dbl showing 3@s if he had that available|pg||
nt|tias:  I find it hard to see 4@s make, but lets see|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: it is just a question of how much 4@S goes down, not whether it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Minihopp:  Defence have 4 tricks from the top, seems hard to lose|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Minihopp:  (3@D, 1@H)|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  But you can ofc duck the @HA and get lost in the way|pg||
nt|tias:  well a trump or a @c lead would do the deal :)|pg||
nt|tias:  no the @hK is in dummy|pg||
nt|tias:  you cannot duck that|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  Ah ofc .)|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|h3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Minihopp:  Rimstedt know to lead partners suit|pg||
nt|scotty: I agree with Kit that West should bid 3@c in preference to GF.  But I don't agree with "if East passes, there won't be a game."  East might pass with, say, xxxx, Axxx, Qx, Jxx|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|tias:  so it looks like 4-5imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|kit: And now 2 rounds of hearts, and declarer will be forced to play for the spades to split|pg||
nt|kit: And when they don't, he will have another heart loser and a trump loser for down 3 by my count|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|tias:  what about cross ruff?|pg||

nt|tias:  but W only needs spades to be 3-3 or 9x|pg||
nt|tias:  a very likely split|pg||
nt|tias:  just not today|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

nt|kit: Although on a club lead 4@S might have some problems.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tias:  but can set up @h10 for a @c discard|pg||
nt|tias:  lets see|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|tias:  2@c = 14-16 6@s or any 17+|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|tias:  2@d = gameforcin versus 17+|pg||
nt|tias:  so approx 8+|pg||
nt|kit: setting up diamond trick looks easier|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@C probably some kind of Gazilli|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  Matias do you know if 3@S is setting @S as trump?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tias:  i think its just 6@s gameforcing|pg||
nt|kit: 2@D GF unless opener is minimum with 2@C natural I would guess|pg||
nt|kit: and probably opener would show minimum by bidding 2@S|pg||
nt|tias:  no as I said Kit 2@c = 6@s 14-16 or any 17+ hand|pg||
nt|tias:  :)|pg||
nt|tias:  and as you said 2@d gf versus the latter|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Mbodell:  The CC says 2@C is 6+@S or 16+ any, so presumably 2@S is just 6+@S and weaker but 3@S is stronger|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tias:  now he wont have problems setting up the @d for a @c discard|pg||
nt|kit: West should play a spade honor on the first round of spades, to try to talk declarer into a "restricted choice" finesse|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  since they open 2@S with 10-13 the 6+@S is always 14+|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  but you can choos to play 2NT on 2@D as 17-19 semibalance-ish with a 6c@S and 3@S as setting spades as trumps if you want|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|tias:  even steven|pg||
nt|tias:  they play 2NT in that sequence as 18-19bal|pg||
nt|tias:  because 1@s 1nt; 2NT = 6-4hands|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer exits with a heart. West needs to shift to a club to break up squeeze|pg||
nt|kit: If East ducks diamond, that is|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Mbodell:  E thinking of ducking this trick to prevent the pitches on @D, but if he does he can be squeezed|pg||

nt|Minihopp:  CR only took 10 tricks in 4@S|pg||
nt|tias:  WHAT A BID by Mikael Rimstedt aka "Ettan"|pg||
nt|kit: A trump shift stops that -- and I don't think declarer has a way to handle it off hand.|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  Ettan = number one|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|kit: Declarer can take the club finesse  and set up clubs -- is that enough?|pg||

nt|Mbodell:  S could tackle clubs with AK and then a ruff instead of finesse, no?  Although the 2@D bid may well suggest finesse better.|pg||
