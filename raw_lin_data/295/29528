nt|pbundy: steve has the values - just not the ones that marc needs|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pef: I predict there will be doubling from this point on|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|pbundy: i predict if there is the contract won't stay here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: i predict when he runs to 4d that will get doubled :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: WRONG again|pg||
nt|pef: so it seems like marc and steve, who are a new partnership had some confusion on this one|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pef: looks like n/s can take at least 7 tricks, but likely to lose at least one on the opening lead|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pef: and if carolyn lynch splits diamonds honors so steve can duck and get four diamond tricks that's up to about 7 tricks for him, maybe|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: last hand of the evening now. 60 more deals tomorrow starting at 10:00 local time (Eastern).  Thanks for being here.  Many thanks to our fine commentators.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pef: this is an interesting hand to end with|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|pbundy: now how many hearts by carolyn?|pg||
nt|reisig: almost a slam|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pef: six spades or six diamonds pretty much on the spade finesse if either is played by east|pg||
nt|pef: except for the minor fact that diamonds go 5-0 hampering 6 diamonds a bit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Cohen alerts 3@S as solid spades|pg||
nt|pef: and the diamond void hampering six spades on a heart lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: close!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzfv: depends on your definition of "solid"|pg||
nt|pbundy: mike knows that they are now :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pbundy: so - will mike find the ruff??|pg||
nt|reisig: best is 6N  :)|pg||
nt|pef: yes|pg||
nt|medwards: Why not bid four diamonds over three spades?|pg||
nt|pef: so let's see if they find a heart and a diamond or if declarer tries to repeat a spade finesse with a diamond to dummy|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pbundy: well; if you think your partner has a solid suit, i don't see why you need to look elsewhere with his hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: method to her madness?|pg||
nt|pef: now he makes this if he plays for spades 2-2, goes down if he tries to repeat a spade finesse|pg||
nt|reisig: That lead ...makes it easy|pg||
nt|pef: big swing potential as they played 4 spades making four in the closed room|pg||
nt|pef: seems like a high heart lead by lynch would be a more popular choice for opening lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pbundy: hard to know......... when steve sees the club queen, he may think that mike has 3 spades|pg||
