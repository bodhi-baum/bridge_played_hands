nt|Vugraphzfb: This is the last board of this set, we will resume at 3:40 Florida time, which is about an hour and a half from now if my computer is set for the right time zone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F|mb|p|nt|Allan Falk: E-W have had one middling accident and their teammates missed a slam swing opportunity; otherwise, a flat set of boards up to now and the deficit has grown to 68.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pef: I hate to differ with my erstwhile partner, but getting to 3c combined with revoking should be classified as more than "middling"|pg||

pc|d2|nt|pef: but when you behind almost any set with 11 minus scores and a passout out of 15 boards is unlikely to feel very good|pg||
