## Background

Bridgescore+ has various tools to detect cheating. These have been written over the last few months, but not released. I had intended to test release some of the tools at the Atlanta Regional tournament in early September 2015.

Based on various bridge cheating allegations in mid August 2015, we accelerated this work.

The coding, testing work is still ungoing. We need to verify that the code works before releasing the data. We have some early results.
