## Detecting Cheating

These tools can be useful to detecting cheating.

Any player, or pair, that deviates significantly from the norm can be suspected of cheating. Proving it using statistical analysis is a lot harder.

These tools can be useful for finding hands that merit further investigation. For example, show me all of the hands where a pair defend against 3NT.
