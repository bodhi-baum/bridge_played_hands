mb|p|nt|HedyG:  i guess over 4@c Nunes is obliged to cue if he can|pg||

mb|5H|nt|boyklas: yeah, Nunes after a serious slam try is obliged to cue|pg||

mb|6S|nt|boyklas: 5@H = 1st round of control and we don't miss two key cards|pg||

nt|HedyG:  Fantoni does, 3@H or 3NT?|pg||
nt|boyklas: 3@h = @h fit|pg||

nt|HedyG:  a 2@H opening by S 10-13 with @H would have shown an unbalanced hand, 5 4 2 2 is not unbalanced so 1NT is systemic|pg||

nt|boyklas: true|pg||
nt|boyklas: @c suit wasn't that good to bypass @ss..|pg||
nt|game over: but I think you are right, over 3@h West can bid 3@s if he is still interested in 3NT and bid 4@c if he does not have a suitable hand (i. e. low tricks)|pg||
