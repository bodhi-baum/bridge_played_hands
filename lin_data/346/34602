nt|ahollan1: top 16 seeded teams that lost:  1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14  and the teams that earlier upset  6 and  15|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Not good to have an odd seed number? :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: The Zagorin Team is Seed 9, we will have to monitor that match closely today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless using original windows bbo, click on EW name to access latest ACBL convention card	 sorry	none available online for NS|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other room is in same contract same opening lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: click on Lee to get his CC from the recent USBC  decent chance that he plays same card Glubok as he did with Hamman|pg||
nt|jkdood: With the @C K offsides this contract seems doomed|pg||
nt|jkdood: 3NT might be unbeatable; but too tough to find|pg||
nt|ahollan1: much to Roland's chagrin  appears that BOTH pairs are playing opening 2@D = Flannery|pg||
nt|jkdood: Needless to say, this boards impact will be a result of which room goes down the least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that explains Glubok's 1N response rather than 1@S |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Lee takes a long time at trick 1 but not on any other trick - I haven't really seen his cards so can only guarantee the @s J is correct :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other notes on the auction   1@H-1@S usually 5+@S or good 4@S that wants opener to raise with 3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Levin's failure to overcall 1@S followed by pre-balance of 2@S shows 4  [5+@S would overcall immediately]|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: mostly facing us    down: bobby levin   left: jan martel  up: brian glubok|pg||
nt|jkdood: 4@S can be set; so the 3N choice there was very fortuitous|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jkdood: With balanced hands and bad trump, 3N is often a better spot than a 4-4 major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Roger Lee knows me well - he brought me water when he went to get it for himself :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would wager that established partnerships better equipped to offer 3N COG [choice of game] after 1m-1M-2M|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: common treatment is that 2N shows EITHER  1-suit @D or @C & @D, weak|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein asked about 3@c but I couldn't make out Glubok's answer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: so opener bids 3@D with good @D fit otherwise 3@C to account for the weak 2-suiter|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N-2@S = range ask  so either BAL raise or 1-suit @C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Flannery with 6@H has been part of the accepted shape for many decades|pg||

nt|jkdood: Some specs claim they love it and also do it with 5-6 shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this past spring i read bridge world magazines from 1964	there was a running dialogue between Eddie Kantar and one from the Bridge Journal menagerie [maybe Jeff Rubens]  about ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this was also the time when there were still 2 camps   open 4-card Majors vs open 5-card Majors|pg||

nt|jkdood: A few pairs; like Robinson-Boyd, use 2@H opener as Flannery|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: with less than reverse strength  opener was stuck with 4522   or  conveyed unauthorized information with pause before rebid|pg||
nt|meargent: minus 100 with trumps to play |pg||
nt|reisig: Just a push result|pg||
