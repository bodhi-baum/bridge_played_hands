mb|p|mb|1D|nt|shuster:	Lee has four times his normal number of spades this time, I'm surprised he didn't open the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: SQ and DQ are right next to each other|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|shuster:	A rather easy six clubs.  Hearts makes as well|pg||
nt|sixela: easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|shuster:  This is the type of setup where competition from N/S would make it easier to diagnose the great fit|pg||
nt|shuster:  and bid slam with confidence|pg||
nt|sixela: W has a perfect hand for his balanced min, everything works|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfh: lee shakes his head, sits straight, raises one eybrow, leans forward|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: snarls|pg||
nt|shuster:  Had it gone - 1@D - (1@S) - 2@C - (2@S);  P - (P) - ??  I'd be ready to bid 6@C|pg||
nt|sixela: easier playing strong js|pg||
mb|6C|nt|shuster:  yes, a very good hand for a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: lee: I don't know what he's doing|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S = art RELAY|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: perhaps forcing 2N    my notes stop here|pg||
nt|shuster:  An anomoly, the West hand has a total of 32 spades over 16 boards.  2 card average over 16 boards is hard to achieve.|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, forces 2NT|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|warrens:  but now I'm lost too|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i have later tentativve note that says after 2N 3@H would show short @S   so the notes |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|Vugraphzff: Lack of Pass cards for N-S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: Hamman team reached 6@C in 5 bids; very efficient, if nothing else|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the same source saying  2@S forced 2N    3@C ask  3@D = 3+ controls|pg||

nt|vugraphzfh: nickell asks would that be ace-asking for NS|pg||
nt|ady: last|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: lee asks did glubok want it to be ace asking, he says "think so, 3@C would be forcing"|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfh: nickell asks what board the other table is on|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|an|nat GF|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|shuster:  In 4@H, declarer can pitch a diamond on a club, so makes without having to guess the suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  most opening leads simplify declarer's task even further|pg||
nt|ady: may try to ruff 3 spades before touching trumps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|shuster:  but the @C10 didn't help him at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: lee begins to ask about lead of @CT|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|shuster:  Declarer has no safe option on this trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: lee turns his head, drops his right hand onto table at sight of @d4|pg||
nt|shuster:  if he plays low, he could suffer a ruff.  If he goes up with the ace, he could suffer a ruff later in the suit|pg||
nt|shuster:  He could go up ace, and play two more clubs before continuing trumps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||
nt|shuster:  Gotta admit, the diamond switch away from the King is unusual,, and declarer is not considering it very likely the switch has come from Kxx|pg||

mc|10|nt|shuster:  Nickel did not cooperate with the clever defense by Katz|pg||
nt|sixela: would have been very tough |pg||
