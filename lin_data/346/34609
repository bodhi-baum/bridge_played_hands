nt|ahollan1: or is that WBF rather than just Europe?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: But not world championships.  I remember walking around for days with Peggy Sutherlin memorizing and practicing our defense to 2@d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over some conventions the written defenses [even ones a pair has authored] becomes part of the OPPONENT'S convention card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Will Boyd lead the @sK?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hold your horses!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they ARE able to refer to them during the auction|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfg: Woolsey "Not the lead I thought I'd see"|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: the caveat is that when there are multiple options -- the pair must agree before play begins|pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead.	Wait till north shows out|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Woolsey didn't expect @HK on previous hand either|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Giggling by Woolsey and Robinson|pg||
