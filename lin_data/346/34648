nt|rolandro: the score is exciting - the Bridge is, hm? I still read Salingers "Catcher in the Rye" - it´s close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  vs NT = attitude|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so High spot card =  i'm not crazy about this suit -- ok if you want to shift|pg||
nt|jtmckee: awfully tuff for pard to read the 8|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  Possibly E could have just invited here, but it is a bidder's game, aggressiveness often wins out....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems reasonable to attack entry to dummy	but @Sx or @SQ??|pg||
nt|rolandro: south finds a way to beat the hand without spade jack with partner - |pg||
nt|Blade: Alex "sees" 9 tricks...1 @s 3@h 5@d....but thers only 8 cause Boye has 4@d....so @s back seems ok|pg||
nt|rolandro: he is looking, I mean|pg||
nt|jtmckee: spade back could easily surrender a 2nd spade and 9th trick|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  even playing attitude, wouldn't the "normal" lead be the 6 from J86??|pg||
nt|jtmckee: north got off to the right suit|pg||
nt|jtmckee: for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 to score     Monaco leads Lavazza by 32|pg||
nt|jtmckee: win 7 or lose 5|pg||
nt|game over: play North for Txx JTxxx Kxx Jxx and cash @c AK?|pg||
nt|Blade: then Boye bids with 8 points and 4 card - @d..?|pg||
nt|game over: 3523 I meant|pg||
nt|rolandro: And this is not good enough - you set up a club trick for west if north has Jxx or not|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  unless E has solid hearts, there is no need to gamble here with a spade, a diamond just is waiting, see what happens....can always shift back to spades if declarer leads clubs.....|pg||
nt|rolandro: spade it is - nothing can be done against 5 diamond winners + heart ace|pg||
nt|Blade: as I stated before Roland..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you decide @S	you must also say  @SK or @Sx|pg||
nt|rolandro: actuelly he can play anything except club + club|pg||
nt|Blade: to say the truth...i dont belive on that high spot against NT...I only saw them play 2nd 4th...nothing else..|pg||
nt|Blade: and if..then its completly new.-..|pg||
nt|rolandro: Ok - let´s invent more nicknames|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Opatija [2014 European Championship] CC says  attitude vs NT|pg||
nt|rolandro: Darth Holland was a good start yesterday :)|pg||
nt|Blade: ok..Opatja is 2 month ago = new :)|pg||
nt|Blade: yes...adn he accepted it|pg||
nt|game over: I am pretty sure they changed from 2/4 to attitude a year or so ago|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  from their card it is not easy to figure out......|pg||
nt|rolandro: they still discuss Bridge - wow - real fanatic - please give me a break - tell me a joke or whatever|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2012 CC also says attitude vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i played attitude for long time with one partner [HIS choice] - but i'm convinced he was always leading 4th anyway|pg||
nt|rolandro: He Gro, wie nennt man gleich die Glatzköpfe mit Springerstiefeln?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: This makes soccer seem exciting|pg||
nt|rolandro: Audience - help me!!! Mir fällt der Name nicht ein!|pg||
