mb|2H!|an|Flannery!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = Flannery  4@S 5/6@H less than reverse strength|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: with 4-fit	sure|pg||

pc|c4|nt|jkdood: For those asking why South there chose 6@H over x; i have no clue|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: perhaps he thought jump to 5@H asked for control in @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rather than preemptive|pg||
nt|jkdood: Thats been a longstanding debate; when 5 of a major is a preempt versus a slam probe; many accidents over the years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we see a lot of unfamiliar partnerships in this round of 16 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially after losing 6 of the top 16 in the round of 32  [and 2 of top 16 in round of 64]|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some partnerships actually allow you to rely on the opps bidding to guess best; I suppose that works most of the time|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Garner-Weinstein was one of the earliest american partnerships to start using transfers in MANY auctions  [esp 1C-1@D/@H]|pg||

nt|jkdood: They are not playing together currently, of course|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Sorry I didn't tell anyone except my two partners who played them with me :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5@D semed doomed to fail, but the defense appears to have let in slip in, in the other room, for a big +600|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Coren deep in thought|pg||
nt|jkdood: A top player/analyst suggests you must lead @H to force a set|pg||
