mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|game over: it is a close decision whether South should overcall or not because against a 14-17 NT you can sometimes make a game on values alone, so you need to keep your bids constructively|pg||

nt|jacksond:  Seems North could have had less for a nv overcall at one level so forcing to game is not clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they also have voice commentary, larger audience and slightly less frequent room crashes|pg||
nt|game over: if East knew that South had a doubleton diamond, he could play the @d 7 to indicate the @d J (given you play UDCA count signals at Trick 1)|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfh: This may be the last making contract?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree  but  i have old instance of ACBL agreement where opening 2N = 20-21|pg||
nt|game over: the advantage of switching 3@h and 3NT is that you have more room to investigate minor-suit fits over 3@h than over 3NT (tyou need more space for no 4/5 card major than for exactly ...|pg||
nt|game over: 5@h))|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is hard to keep up with the ever changing agreements for EW|pg||
nt|game over: downside: the opponents can double 3@h (sometimes) and 4@d (retransfer) over 3NT (showing 5@h) and the additional memory load|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|sixela: what on earth is 5c?|pg||
nt|game over: 0/3 keycards (guess)|pg||
nt|game over: (out of 4 aces)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Long written explanation of 5@c, can't see it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Although perhaps Smirnov was explaining something else including 4NT?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if showing Aces  presumably with uncertainty about accepting slam invite  other wise just blast 6N|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Now Piek explaining 5@c at length|pg||
nt|game over: in this type of situation (4NT = quantitative) Rosenberg/Willenken for example try to use the space up to 5NT to intelligently find out whether 5NT is the maximum (as opposed to ...|pg||
nt|game over: 6NT ;)) - many experts hate to play in 5NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  14 [4@S-3]  Graves playing 3@S  [he also opened 1@S]|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|sixela: if he showed 20-21, he should just pass 4nt, if he showed less than that, 6d seems right to show his 5 card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Trying for the "Moysian"?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another agreement	 bid 4-card suits at 5-level and 5-card suits at 6-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jacksond:	hardly getting a favourable spade lead now|pg||

nt|game over: wow, declarer has 11 tricks now and it looks like he can squeeze South in the red suits (he will probably play a diamond to the jack now, test diamonds and then has no chance but ...|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sixela: slam is now cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Does a @d back cut off the entry?|pg||
nt|sixela: no idea why N chose to lead a spade, club lead seemed so routine|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think @D just means squeeze card with be @C in declarer's hand|pg||
nt|sixela: no, slam is cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Fisher in the proverbial "brown study"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone else having flashback to first time you read  Clyde Love's	 "Bridge Squeezes Complete"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: Hand on chin, all suddenly very quiet|pg||
nt|game over: ithout a spade lead - this is interesting double-dummy, (single-dummy you would just play a diamond to the jack) - if you cash six black suits, South can keep four diamonds and ...|pg||
nt|game over: three hearts, if you then establish your heart trick, endplaying South he can exit with the !q leaving you with a spade loser I think) - I didnot ask GIB|pg||
