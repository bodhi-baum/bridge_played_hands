nt|KiwiBridge: action from the start|pg||
nt|iverson200: 1@h = 14+ unless have the other major ,1@s 0-9 4+@s|pg||
nt|iverson200: yes Gary|pg||
nt|iverson200: trump 3-0 break may pose declarer with some problems|pg||
pc|h6|nt|iverson200: he needs to estblish @ds, ruffing finesse @h and draw trumps... it seems the communication is a bit short unless N helps|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: DD a @D to K and @S back, surprised Fantoni didn't find it :)|pg||
nt|iverson200: W has to be thinking why N is leading a small @h now, a bit unusual|pg||
nt|iverson200: can it be S has singleton @h and @s K is onside, but even so, top ruffing will put the hand in a difficult situation... so i think he will discard a @s, hoping S still has @hs|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: sorry I've been told that is the only def to give the contract :(|pg||
nt|iverson200: It is not clear how the other table made it, but a very good score for Monaco |pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: no wonder he didn't do it !|pg||
nt|iverson200: The other table switched @s on trick 2, not a favorable choice either|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: makes us mere mortals wonder why they double:)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|iverson200: if he makes the right choice and discard a @s from dummy, the hand will be simpler despite trump 3-0 breaks|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||
nt|iverson200: crossruff would do as dummy has two top trumps to take care of 2 @h ruffs and small trumps to ruff @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: supposedly video too   but i'm having trouble  [not just getting the video]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you're using web based bbo -- there should be a tab for "video"|pg||
nt|iverson200: Fantoni knows things are not looking good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  i'm told just one active video feed right now	not for this table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told  the active video just for Hamman match|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: the one that's not close? :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the new tab is lower left	  "other table"  "gib" "results" "video"|pg||
nt|iverson200: after declarer made the correct choice at trick 2, the hand is pretty much over. Had Fantoni returns a @d declarer will have some trouble and potentially go down, but that is quite ...|pg||
nt|iverson200: difficult given his @d holdings|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: RDBL says some 44 or 54|pg||
nt|iverson200: XX = Scrambling, at least 44|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 1-5+suit Nunes would bid that suit|pg||
nt|iverson200: they found a 4-4 fit to avoid being penalized, so it is up to E-W to bid game now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: i don't know how forcing the DBL//PASS combination is  so unclear if Upmark can or should DBL 3@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iverson200: I dont think they would compete to 3@c with adverse vul... but 3@c probably shows a good spade raise or general strength to force game and ask for stopper|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|iverson200: W with extra and @c stopper, bids 3nt, and E with a hand with good @s raise, corrected to 4@s|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ok   i'll go along with 3@C game try |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose decision to make constructive raise means you're committed to accepting 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still looks close to me|pg||
nt|iverson200: @c @c ruff, if it gets overruffed, can still go for @d finesse|pg||
nt|iverson200: if it does not get overruffed, finesse @s, and take 10 tricks to avoid any risks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other matches:   Hamman 20-0 set thru 53  trails Team Assael by 27 // Meltzer leads Schwartx by 31  //  Lavazza over Grue by 7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all matches playing unique set of hands|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: unusual Al, is that for security?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same room also hosting lower flights of "mini-spingold"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually very usual for ABCL|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: I see, but not world wide?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually ACBL ONLY uses same boards in Semi-Final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in ACBL-land  that is somewhat dependent upon size of the room|pg||
nt|iverson200: play small @d to T now also looks ok, immediate finessing @d K might have a bit risk when N starts with AQJ 5 carder but it gets an overtrick here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: rest of world tends to play same boards AND players enter scores with  bridgemate [or equivalent]	to allow realtime running scores|pg||

pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: Hamman again put on late spring  but came up short this time|pg||
nt|iverson200: interetsting Fantoni responded 1@h instead of 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after studying a lot of data   i've come to conclusion that slowest table can be predicted by seeing which room i'm in|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just blame al|pg||

nt|kareno: It's always Al's fault.  |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|iverson200: as he has 12 and 1@h is 0-11 and 1NT=10+ balanced, so he probably wants his partner to decalre|pg||
nt|bebechira: this day will be remembered for a long time...3 out of 4 matches cliffhangers ...75% lol|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: no Karen it's Al who explains all the tricky system bids for us :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  isnt everyone always in the slowest room Al? :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Traian, the specs are incredibly lucky when that happens!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  lost item is always found in the last place you look|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or    STOP LOOKING    bah dah bump|pg||
nt|iverson200: declarer has 8 tricks.. might not be easy to develop 9th if @c A is offside!|pg||
nt|iverson200: so not easy to play|pg||
nt|bebechira: just wonderful for bridge..lets hope more people are starting playing the game....from today|pg||
nt|iverson200: declarer has to cater for worst scenarios and bad breaks|pg||

nt|bebechira: Karen Allison http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=3911|pg||
nt|kareno: Well east did overcall and there aren't too many values floating around|pg||

nt|ahollan1: etc|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: etc indeed|pg||
nt|bebechira: Mats Nilsland http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=3770|pg||
nt|iverson200: if he plays a @d now, he is banking on one of the majors suits will behave. because if @c A offside you almost gave up the chances of major suit chances|pg||
nt|iverson200: if defence can cash 5 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: semi finals   one match has 5-person team [lavazza]   other has 4-person team  [team assael]|pg||
nt|jkdood: play a @D now E clears suit while still w @C Ace. If test a major and play a club, e can continue clubs and gets real sticky|pg||
nt|iverson200: you cant give too much credibility on a favorable 2@d overcall and a AT9 6 cader, not necessicaily he has the @c A, although it is likely but not that likely|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it was even less point promising at other table after 1N-2@C Stayman|pg||
nt|jkdood: Then there are squeezes on W.  And if thats not enough pressure; the match is def on the line|pg||
nt|iverson200: The other room finessed @c K, a direct approach. but it is by no means clear cut|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|nilsland:  and IF 3N goes down FN may bid and make the slam in board 64....|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iverson200: if E is an agressive bidder, you have to evaluate the probability more carefully|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|KiwiBridge: that killed the excitement for the specs Mats|pg||
