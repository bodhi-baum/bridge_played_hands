mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ritong: so 1NT is a puppet to 2@c|pg||
nt|ritong: here intending to convert to x @hs|pg||
mb|2S|nt|djneill:  may North is playing a deep game, not wanting to reveal the long clubs for fear E-W with a stiff will realize the true potential|pg||
nt|djneill:  maybe*|pg||
mb|d|nt|djneill:  Nunes was restricted to 4 or 5 spades with the double, so 2@s is not really that far fetched, but still, pretty bad hand :-)|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|djneill:  and North Passed over 1NT, so likely North has a balanced strong NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||
nt|djneill:  this would be an interesting contract|pg||
mb|3D|nt|djneill:  hmm, if E-W are correctly explaining, North has at most 2 hearts, so the XX sounds more like 3 spades than SOS (with such short majors North would have opened 1@d and rebid 2@c e.g.)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: discussion about meaning of the bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  of course North could theoretically have 5 diamonds, maybe South thinks West is actually transferring to clubs with clubs (rather than a "transfer cue-bid raise")|pg||
