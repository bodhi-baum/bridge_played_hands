nt|jkotor: i am an amateur, i lead @h here |pg||
nt|stigw: Clubs will be a good start for the defence here.|pg||
nt|game over: since I get comments from kiebitzers: in the last board East led the lowest club (2/4), which is surely not a false-card, so his distribution is known to be 2524 after you drew ...|pg||
nt|game over: trumps, so no reason to misguess diamonds if East does not cover|pg||
nt|jkotor: as a rule of thumb vs unknown NT when having hand with entries|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s7|nt|panja: he will try to make...so he is much more likely to play @ST from dummy.|pg||

nt|jkotor: i would not be so sure|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S will need @H lead to defeat...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if defending 4S by E, in order to defeat S must lead a small doubleton with no trump control|pg||
nt|jkotor: if 3@h means "invitational with 6+@s"|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|stigw: Yes, and that wont be found, I'm sure. 4 H  not actual (but also making).|pg||
nt|serhat: even if they reched 5C Kalita will lead @H|pg||

nt|jkotor: K-N play natural system, not Polish @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|AndersK: opps|pg||
nt|serhat: ohh boy change again|pg||
nt|jkotor: so 1@c was natural 3+|pg||
nt|panja: South had a difficult choice...|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: yap, it is always hard when seeing only 1 hand|pg||
nt|panja: note that the first dbl is skewed....|pg||
nt|stigw: N/S might be on their way to 5 cl, whre the 4-0 division with a stopper makes it impossible to make (but ok sacrifice).|pg||
nt|game over: overtrick or just made does not matter here - strange|pg||
nt|jkotor: or just 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not as hard to find the heart lead as it would be on other auctions. When N has made t/o double (and then a second one) and opps reach 4S and you have 3 small trumps, partner is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: big favorite to have good hearts (and maybe a trump entry)|pg||
nt|game over: ah, sorry, Poland scored 100 not Sweden in the other room|pg||
nt|stigw: Did he pass 3 sp doubled, I dont believe that ???|pg||
nt|nilsland:  the first double is obvious with the strong hand, and the second too imo|pg||
nt|panja: what does dbl of 1@C show? tolerance to other suits? just strength? |pg||
nt|panja: South's P is perfectly understandable...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|nt|adonis18:  on a spade lead N makes 3 nt|pg||
nt|jkotor: X on 1@c normally means: either T-O for other 3 suits (mostly for majors) or very strong hand|pg||
nt|game over: 630 or 730 are both 12 IMPs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jkotor: at least in Poland and in most Europe countries|pg||
nt|adonis18:  sorry, nonsense:)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  if the first double is a normal take out double it shows either support for other suit OR any hand with 17+|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|serhat: 3H must be long @S I dont agree with S having 3 small spades|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|stigw: And the poles found the defence aginst 4 sp x to put that down. A huge gain for Poland, bringing them into the lead with only 4 boards remaining.|pg||
nt|jkotor: so 2nd X = strong and T-O thru spades, or maybe T-O thru @s and @c, and S red suits are not so good|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Souths holding in spades suggest a bid I think|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|AndersK: I agree Mads!|pg||
nt|serhat: big gain for Poland and young Klukowsky :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|game over: South left the room|pg||
nt|AndersK: pass too dangerous, and 4 @C probably no disaster, and if partner goes to 4 @D I have Jxx, so no danger!|pg||
nt|jkotor: But what if partner has strong hand with 8-9 cards in @d+@h ? and only 2 clubs 2 spades???|pg||
nt|game over: North is looking at South's hand, obviously not happy|pg||
nt|serhat: then he will convert|pg||
nt|jkotor: once again: 1@c was natural, and there was a lot of space takien with jump, |pg||

nt|jkotor: my question is: what if N has 19-20 HCP with lets say 2-4-5-2? are we willing to give them 200-500 on red suit contract?|pg||
nt|barnets: EW can make 4@H|pg||
nt|panja: lots of kibs telling me...it was a Club lead in other room..to @CJ, then a @D finesse into safe hand|pg||
nt|stigw: Look like a tremendous result for Poland here, bidding and making an improbable 3 nt contract. I guess this is the end for Sweden.|pg||
nt|serhat: looks like auto make for 3nt if they bid|pg||
nt|game over: the good news for the Swedes is that South has a 20/21 NT available as well (opening 2@c)|pg||

nt|serhat: but how about a @D lead! :)|pg||

nt|AndersK: I beleve Wrang / Sylvan play 2 NT as 22-23 ish and the 19-20 is NT is in the 2@C opening system|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  this is 19-20 balanced or some game force, the idea being that North can bid 2M to play over it|pg||
nt|game over: 2@c = 20/21 bal or any GF|pg||
nt|game over: 2NT opening would have been 22-24|pg||
nt|stigw: Only in the South hand I believe. God has been on the polish side in this deal, I imagine. The swedes helped them a lot in the previous deal, and here another punishment !|pg||
nt|jkotor: i feel like this is a great final! Many dynamic boards with decisional swings, many boards with great technical play from both sides|pg||
nt|dburn:  he might also be able to bid 3m to play over it|pg||
nt|game over: North can bid 3@d now - weak with diamonds - if I read their convention card correctly|pg||
nt|barnets: in closed 2N -3@C - 3@H what was that ?|pg||
nt|dburn:  no major|pg||
nt|game over: 3@h = no four/five-card major?|pg||
nt|dburn:  3@s = five spades, 3NT = five hearts|pg||
nt|dburn:  3@d = some four-card major|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|stigw: Maybe the swedes have some fransfer-methods here, we will see.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|barnets: but north then bid 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  this looks like the start of a bailout into 3@d|pg||
nt|panja: S might still bid 3N now..|pg||

nt|jkotor: now 3nt not possible if Nowosadzki heard about leads from sequences|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3N on the wrong hand now|pg||

mb|3D|nt|AndersK: after the last hand Im quite certain that Fredric would like to declear 3 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: Yes, that seems promising, but then again - what now. Probably just 3 di for playing yhere, as normally would be the best.|pg||

nt|panja: y, wrongsided...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|AndersK: He took the highroad and follwed the system!|pg||

nt|kit: all games make here I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: i thought  RDBL = F2@D, 10+ HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe kingleton @D  = 2|pg||
nt|DavidStern:  E/W will do well to get to 5@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kit: 4H and 3NT ok also I believe|pg||
nt|sommer:  3NT is the easiest game|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|DavidStern:  Yes easiest but based on pips and leads whereas 5@C is pretty good|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|DavidStern:  East 3@S now and west 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: so likely relatively flat board|pg||
nt|DavidStern:  4@H prblematic on diamond diamond|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|granguru:  @SA @DA and small @S might beat 3NT from W, but they avoided that contract |pg||
nt|sommer:  E has maximum..what will he try?|pg||
nt|DavidStern:  Sorry I meant spade Ace and low spade|pg||
