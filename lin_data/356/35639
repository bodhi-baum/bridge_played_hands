nt|roswolf:  declarer can make this but there are some tempting plausible alternatives|pg||
nt|roswolf:  fair comment david but what else can he bid?|pg||

pc|sA|nt|roswolf:  yes indeed|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  You would only be allowed to commentate on Scottish events.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|phil_20686:  Although there is some interest about whether E-W might get to 6NT rather than 6H here.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 hearts needs spade ace on side plus heart break - or no spade lead and heart break|pg||

nt|iain sime: Good stop, and to be fair they didn't know that @S ace was onside.. |pg||
nt|phil_20686:	possibly further limited by the 4c cue if they have a serious/non serious.|pg||
nt|phil_20686:	Was it a good stop iain? I am not so sure. I would like to be in 6H or 6N here I think|pg||
nt|phil_20686:	if easts diamond Q had been a spade Q then slam might have been extremely good|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to cash diamonds now|pg||
nt|iain sime: Tosh happy to have missed slam at trick two- game is not a certainty from his standpoint.  |pg||
