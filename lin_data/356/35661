nt|thak: atleast Sunil doesn't think so:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rv: good that they are on same page|pg||
nt|rv: (1y)-X-(1M)-X is usually played as penalty primarily to expose baby psyches |pg||
nt|rv: in CR, Sunit is in 3n on E-W hand|pg||

nt|thak: can't pitch @CQ|pg||
nt|thak: and small @C exposes him to stepping stone|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|rv: not bad slam on N-S hands|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|rv: @cT in North hand makes slam quite good on combined N-S hands|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: 1@c is 18+|pg||
nt|thak: @D lead will put paid to any slam|pg||
nt|thak: by N|pg||
nt|rv: East might lead so-called safe @HT:)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|thak: even so, the breaks are cruel|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: @s finesse works, 4@cs+4@h+3@s+@DA rite|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: East caught in major suit squeeze on non @d lead|pg||
nt|thak: declarer will probably risk only @S to J|pg||
nt|thak: and then will have to play for sqz|pg||
nt|rv: declarer will test @hs before taking @sJ finesse and clearing @cs assuming Kista ducks this|pg||
nt|thak: he maybe tempted to play high @C here|pg||
nt|rv: yes that is risk|pg||
nt|thak: playing for benign breaks|pg||

mb|p|nt|thak: since you cd have 12 top with 5 @H 4@C 2@S 1@D without risking any finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Mohan is in inspired form on slam deals|pg||
nt|thak: and finesse can be a backup if either suit fails to break|pg||
