mb|d|nt|ahollan1: does Forrester bid 2@C with intention of bidding more if Gold 5@S rather than 4@S?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@C does promise some game interest    2@D by Forrester would just ask better major with no game interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = ASK preferred M  a) weak  b) F2N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  West opened 3@d in third seat at the other table, and no one saw a reason to bid over that|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  11 tricks we believe.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2:  NS also had @DA on 17.|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|jacksond:	Yes 3D describes the hand perfectly and NS believed him|pg||
nt|vugraphzgr: they are not good at confirming how many tricks|pg||
nt|dburn:  I suppose that by ducking one diamond and two spades, North-South might make 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 1@H by Gold would show 5+suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|dburn:  but after the 3@d opening declarer might win the first diamond for fear of a spade shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:	after a 1@d opening, it isn't going to be easy for North-South to get to game here either|pg||
nt|dburn:  and they might not make it if they do get to it|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|eamongall: some brave man on the voice commentary is claiming he made a 3@D opening bid on a 4333 hand and it worked :) |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:	well, they got to it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn:  and East will no doubt be fined several more VPs for not doubling it|pg||

nt|dburn:  if East drops the seven, and declarer tries to pin the ten...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|dburn:	he received three rounds of hearts, the last of which he ruffed in his hand (North)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|nt|dburn:  and could then have succeeded by playing three rounds of spades - East would have to let him back into hand to pick up diaonds|pg||
