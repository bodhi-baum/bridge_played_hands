pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn:  already they have ceded trump control to declarer, and set up dummy's suit into the bargain|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn:  and in fact, if South plays a heart now (which looks natural), declarer can make|pg||
nt|dburn:  so this diamond shift, not at all obvious, is good defence|pg||
