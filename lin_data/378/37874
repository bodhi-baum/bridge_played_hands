mb|1C!|nt|paulg:  Two very experienced pairs here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Hanlon-McGann play Carrot Club, where 1@c is a weak no-trump or any 17+ hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  They are very aggressive bidders.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgu: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:	Sime close to bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hanlon debating whether to double or bid some number of no-trump|pg||
nt|paulg:  in competition McGann would presume that Hanlon has a weak no-trump, so he's probably denied as much as six points|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  the problem with doubling to try and find a fit is that it will wrongside the hand and let West lead a heart through the king|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  eventually Hanlon will give up and just bid 3NT|pg||
