nt|kit: the double looks pretty optimistic to me|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  4D X.. that makes things complicated|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: sry there has been a director call|pg||
nt|medwards: orth might get off to the wrong lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: s lead by accident|pg||
nt|kit: After double of 4@D, North is likely to get off to wrong lead.|pg||
nt|kit: so what did South lead out of turn?  Might make a difference.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: K of spades|pg||
nt|kit: So the question is, who was responsible for lifting the screen|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  yup|pg||
nt|kit: Not normal lead out of turn regulations when screens are involved|pg||
nt|kit: Both South and West equally responsible for making sure screen not lifted after lead out of turn.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|kit: Double of 2@C risky, but it might show a big gain here, as I can see declarer going down.|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ovncylmz:  2@s shows stopper I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: After club to ace and a club, it will be natural for declarer to finesse -- and later lose to doubleton queen of hearts off maybe.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Same double at other table, but queen of clubs lead didn't test declarer quite as much.|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  usually no stopper = pass. bids=with stopper|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: If not, it looks like 6@C is flat out on a guess for the queen of clubs.  With no spots at all, both plays are equally likely to succeed.|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  like tebha opened 1nt with 19. zhou opens with 13|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  lots of 17s are upgraded. but other table didnot upgrade this one|pg||

nt|ovncylmz:  interesting that zhou did not ask for @HQ|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  i mean @CQ |pg||

nt|kit: Looks like he simply failed to count his tricks properly|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: He played the 7 of clubs after south told him what the bids were|pg||
nt|kit: However, it still may make on double squeeze if heart to king and ace.	It may be key for West to duck the first heart|pg||
