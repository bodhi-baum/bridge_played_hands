nt|dburn:  this is a constructive weak two bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: 3@C shows a 6-4|pg||
nt|dburn:  I think 3@c shows a second suit, 3@d asks and 3@s shows diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn:	well, it's possible|pg||
nt|newmoon: Italy match:  6@D and 6@S, both +1|pg||
mb|5D|nt|dburn:  if spades are agreed, Brock will discover one key card, @sQ and @dK|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  If ever there was a case for passing with 9 points and a 6-card spade suit, however, this South hand is an example of that (with so many controls outside).|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm if 4NT is keycard for diamonds then south has two keycards, not one|pg||
mb|6D|nt|dburn:  then, with a 5-4 diamond fit, seven is a reasonable proposition|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|athene: south obviously thinks 4nt is keycard for spades but surely it must be for diamonds|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Why not 4@D from South instead of 3@S. Wow, they have bid it anyway. Well done!|pg||
