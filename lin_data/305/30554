mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tokay1975: 2nt made it gf  after 2dia|pg||
nt|kit: Real problem on opening lead here|pg||
nt|Fluffy: for BILs: this is the example of why against NT you need 3 honors to lead one, playing NT you have no rush and need to care about third and 4th round of the suit|pg||
nt|tokay1975:	nunes  never lead  top diamond	in this level|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Fluffy: if the contract was a suit one, leading @dK stands out as you need to score tricks quickly since someone will have doubleton|pg||
nt|cuan: HH in closed will open lauria's hand 1NT 15-17. Probably both pairs in the same contract|pg||

nt|cuan: lauria goes for making|pg||
nt|benjent:  Still got some timing problems|pg||
nt|cuan: @S to 10|pg||
nt|Fluffy: he is off timing for making now I think, norh will play @sJ when in with heart putting declarer on a no win decision, winning @sA allows south to entry with @sK while not winning ...|pg||
nt|Fluffy: ir blocks the hand|pg||
nt|kit: He will have to assume North has king of clubs .. so take it from there.|pg||
nt|Fluffy: or perhaps north is endplayed|pg||
nt|benjent:  We have the advantage of seeing all 4 hands ... and GIB. Lauria does not :)|pg||
nt|kit: If he leads a spade to 10 and jack, which he might, North's best return is a club -- Declarer can't afford to win queen, as that is entry to long heart.|pg||
nt|Fluffy: I Was thinking of @c to ace and hearts, where a @sJ back will see the defence prevail|pg||
nt|benjent:  He might - hoping for @sK-3rd in the pocket, or some suicide squeezing|pg||
nt|kit: So maybe club to ace, heart finesse, ace of hearts, and a heart is best. |pg||
