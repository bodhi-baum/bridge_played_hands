nt|dburn:  3NT shows this kind of hand for a lot of players - running spades, side stoppers|pg||
nt|dburn:  not a balanced 19-20 - with that, either open 2NT or rebid 2NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  South is a bit fixed here - no major-suit doubleton to lead|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  To defeat 4@S, North would need to find the South hand in hearts or clubs and then have a lie of the cards where declarer could lose two diamond tricks. Of perhaps lead passively with a trump.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  But 3NT better.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn:  may well pick a heart because of the general trend towards passivity - but probably the best shot is to find partner with the king of diamonds and some fifth trick for the defence|pg||
pc|h2|nt|BroLucius:  Other table... East could bid 2@H and continued with 3NJT over 3@S rebid. West cue-bid 4@C and they stopped in 4@S.|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn:  the defence won't get all its tricks here, so the USA will pick up an IMP or so|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Diamond lead from North (which looks best lead, not that it matters) gave early comfort to declarer.|pg||
nt|dburn:  Wolpert may be worried about 4-1 spades, so doesn't want to cash the hearts and throw dummy's minor-suit cards on them|pg||
nt|dburn:  because that would leave the defence with too many winners if the spades did not break|pg||
nt|dburn:  but if spades are 4-1, she has no certain entry to dummy anyway|pg||
nt|dburn:  so she might as well just get on with it|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Declarer has 4 hearts and 3 spades. Perhaps she is wondering if there is any way to make when spades 4-1.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|BroLucius:  I am not in Bali but from what I can tell it seems to have been very well organised.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|BroLucius:  A kibitzer tells me that she is yet to see a single UNDO from the operators. (My average would be one per board).|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  1@D shows hearts. 1NT rebid is very strong since no 1@H rebid (to show 12-14) and no 1NT opener.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  3NT seems to lose three clubs and a heart for an easy make.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  4@H not so good, but North emphasized her hearts.|pg||

nt|BoBecky: Needed to win trick 1 in dummy.|pg||
nt|glenne:  three rounds of clubs now?|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Now three rounds of clubs will expose the spade blockage|pg||
nt|BoBecky: Or a @d.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Both teams have leaked IMPs, not reaching their previous excellent standard. It will be better, I am sure, in the succeeding sets. |pg||
