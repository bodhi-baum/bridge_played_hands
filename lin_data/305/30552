nt|serhat: 7S is a hard to bid here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there won't be a tie	England actually has  0.33 imps that don't show on BBO|pg||
nt|serhat: infact 6S can go down if you misguess the @D Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you play @HA @H ruff  or start with 1 or 2 rounds of trump?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm pretty sure 2 rounds of @S is non-optimal   just not sure about 0 vs 1|pg||
nt|serhat: I think I would cash the @S|pg||

nt|Tez: some spect says now Germany 159, USA 153|pg||
nt|granguru:  a very special congratulation for his job|pg||
nt|diana_eva:  Traian also set up all the tables and coordinated vug on the floor - which was probably harder than setting up the webcam :)|pg||
nt|diana_eva:  Thanks everyone - great show!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  thanks BBO|pg||
nt|granguru:  Traian also set up all the tables and coordinated vug on the floor - which was probably harder than setting up the webcam|pg||

nt|nemeo: Thanks everyone, was great to be here :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  A great experience which surely will be improved in the next championships|pg||
nt|cuan: Great job by all |pg||
nt|granguru:  mainly with special readable cards|pg||
nt|granguru:  2 methods can be used bar codes or similar wich can be converted to a digital signal|pg||
nt|granguru:  cameras will read the card when it is played at a specific position on the trail|pg||
nt|granguru:  same as the biddings ...bidding boxes will have also bar codes or some detecting	media|pg||
nt|granguru:  to read them electronically|pg||
nt|cuan: ... and in a few time, "Mameli sound" for the gold medal (Fratelli d'Italia, l'Italia s'√® desta, dell'elmo di Scipio s'√® cinta la testa ...)|pg||
nt|granguru:  there will be a vugraph operator just for minor needs|pg||
nt|cuan: bye all, and tx again :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  the other, less probable for the moment, is to use electronic devices to play... |pg||
nt|nemeo: Bye all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  no more physical cards|pg||
nt|granguru:  which was once already discarded at the Belladonna, Avarelli, Garozzo, Forquet, D'Alelio Pabis-Ticci era |pg||
nt|granguru:  Beefeater goes further thinking that capacitive screens would be simple enough to setup and deploy|pg||
nt|granguru:  once the area of the screen is activated, the signal from that depression would register in the main server which in turn would showing everyone what is happening|pg||
nt|granguru:  well enough of Julius Verne's thoughts for the moment...have a nice day all|pg||
nt|granguru:  tks to all of you, Beefeater included (the player)|pg||
