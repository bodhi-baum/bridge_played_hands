mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how much better does west hand need to be for  4@H-DBL?|pg||
nt|serhat: infact 6D has no chance! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming that should show @H|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: note: Lauria's 1N denied a hand that is invite w/ 6@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  Madalas 2N is stronger than Fantunes Jx xxxxx Axxxx x :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuan: 3NT not the best here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  EW had no chance finding the heart fit - but that may be for their best if S passes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am a little surprised that Bocchi bid 3N even if he has a spade stopper|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  he also has very good minor|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nemeo: both 3@h and 3@s were available to show strong hand without bypassing 3NT, so i wonder if they are in control or not|pg||
nt|cuan: well bid by the italians|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nemeo: it seems they were :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|nilsland:  close to 6 also here - but impossible to avoid a spade loswe|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuan: normal double finesse in diamonds for making|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk  3nt  is not nat . ( a little slam try  with extras ) they	do notplay 3nt	after showing 55  65minors |pg||

nt|nilsland:  ok - that explains it|pg||
mc|11|nt|nilsland:  for me I would bid 4@C|pg||
nt|cuan: @D to queen revealed 4-0 break|pg||

nt|tokay1975: with stiff  h  norby never   bid 3nt to play its impossible  when his pd shows  10 cards n minors|pg||
nt|nilsland:  of course you are right Musti :)|pg||
nt|nemeo: bye all, ciao :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3N shows extra values without keycard but real support|pg||
