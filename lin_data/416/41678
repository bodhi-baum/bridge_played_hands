nt|roswolf:  yes dont hang partber for protecting|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham:  and 3NT won't make - by the time you have run the spades (and you need them 3-2) you have squeezed yourself |pg||
nt|athene: it might look natural to draw trumps, run the @HQ then lead a club up, but of course declarer does not know the @CA is onside|pg||
nt|athene: but you are probably going down if it isn't, on this shift|pg||
nt|athene: there are many possibilities to consider, though|pg||
nt|athene: like trying to establish a diamond trick for a club pitch|pg||
nt|athene: or winning this trick in hand, running @HQ, then leading a spade to the ace and hoping south only started with two trumps, so the @HA will stand up|pg||
nt|roswolf:  yes declarer will try to make the contract against all probable layouts but essentially will find things very friendly|pg||
