nt|phil_20686:	There are several ways to beat 4h. |pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Not so easy to beat it, in practice.|pg||
nt|phil_20686:	with the spades 7-1 north cannot get south on lead before trumps are drawn|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|phil_20686:	Another possible fariation is a 3S opening from south|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil_20686:  Possible to make 4S if you pick the diamond position|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: another way of looking at it - declarer has 5 heart and 1 spade trick so only needs 4 diamond tricks - cant stop 4 diamond tricks unless pd is void|pg||
pc|hK|nt|BroLucius:  3@S was pre-emptive, aiming to shut out East. As it happens, East would probably have passed 2@S.|pg||

nt|phil_20686:	Does east always double with this type of shape, or was it a state of the match kind of thing?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s9|pc|d2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Would not be state of the match - halfway through and opnly 20+ IMPs in it.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  East had a tricky hand to bid. Not attractive to overcall 2@H on that suit.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: the way they play is that 2D shows diamonds and hearts - with the big hand with diamonds they jump to 3D after doubling|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|odysseus69: a boring one- the team in front welcomes as many of these as possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|BroLucius:  For some, 2@H shows either hearts or strong balanced. 2@S enquires and 2NT shows balanced.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: chance to see a "poor" toy- coudnt make me play this unless I was feeling suicidal|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  With 4-5 in the majors, East might have bid 3@D (transfer), intending to rebid 3@S. But on such weak suits he may have needed 4-card heart support. |pg||
nt|BroLucius:  You play it on Monday mornings?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|phil_20686:  This seems like a slight hole in their bidding to me, seems natural to reach 4h. Fortuneately it will not cose on this deal with Qx heart coming down and the diamonds 4-3|pg||
