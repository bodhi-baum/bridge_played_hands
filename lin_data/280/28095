nt|nilsland:  now NS makes a slam with the wrong lead|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  and east west can sacrifice in 5@S?|pg||
mb|1D!|an|8-15, any 5+M|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|nilsland:  yes - seems to be 1-2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: D = Penalty if partner has @S|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|timverbeek:  if west would have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  think north will bid 5@H, but this is definately the downside of this system|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West will surely bid again|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  wonder why north didnt open 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|nt|timverbeek:  seems like a quite obvious bid |pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzew: Maybe he doesn't like preempting on voids, Mats? :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I dont agree with open 4H |pg||
nt|timverbeek:  why not?|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: Everyone is confident they have the best cards at the table :)|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzew: except East|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I dont like bidding more than I can make|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  so solid 10 card when you open 4?|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  well I know every country has his things, Dutch like to preempt although not as agressive as the Danish|pg||
nt|timverbeek:  Swedes like artificial (like these people) while Norwegians like as simple as possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: Running scores: http://tinyurl.com/bwkgyql|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|nilsland:  Strategen team is from Northern Sweden, JÃ¤mtland, Ãstersund if you know that|pg||
nt|bt:  Now it is obvious to make 12|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: they play no changes after pre-pass which is kind of funny. He still showed 12-14 hcp any, but upgraded his 11-count|pg||
