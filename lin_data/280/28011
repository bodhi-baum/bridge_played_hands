nt|BroLucius:  2@S (for many) shows a sound 3-card raise of hearts. 2NT would show a 4-card raise.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  2@S agreed hearts and 3@C meant that North could not be sure whether to bid game or not.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Anyway, that is a high quality push board, with both teams making +620.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  There was some rough bidding in the first set. That was much better.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: like a trump lead which prevents 2 club ruffs if thas what was needed- we know that only 1 was needed but....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it sounded as if Norths shape was as it actually was - making Phils suggestion of a trump switch attractive-|pg||
nt|phil_20686:	I wonder if norths 3c did not actually show clubs|pg||
nt|phil_20686:	two spades and then a low club is what you would do if they had just banged down 4H without showing clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it wasnt alerted and they seem to bid what they got|pg||
nt|odysseus69: on the second spade West should play his highest warning against club|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cigarette break?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no -thats 8 boards in a flash|pg||
nt|odysseus69: big swing was the slam - impossible for South- he opened 1C and partner showed big hand with fit and heart void - his clubs were poor and AQ of hearts lokked like waste paper|pg||

nt|Rodal F: 14 for Penfold|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  On that last deal, the Bulgarians bid excellently, N/S at the other table.|pg||
nt|roswolf: last bd of the set|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Worth stretching to a borderline 6@D when the opponents are likely to sacrifice anyway.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: thanks to all the usual suspects and to our specs|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this could be horrible for someone|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Tkx to David - Geoff - specs and the best one THE VUG OPERATOR|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: restart for set 3 will be 5-10 mins after the end of this hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Seems so|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  In one of the England Ladies team's gold medal wins, there was a board involving Nevena Senior, where there was confusion as to which major the Multi bidder had. England might have lost a double-figure swing but gained one instead. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the vampires gather for tea and jam of the human variety|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The opponents guessed wrongly and were enlightened by Heather Dhondy's double.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Charlsen  must now judge whether North holds hearts.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is no spot to protect|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Only one way to find. X|pg||
nt|roswolf: easts pass is good judgment|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Rodal F: I just wonder abought one thing. Why 5@D?|pg||

nt|Rodal F: A spec said that N might waited a 4-6 hand. Never.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|BroLucius:  Peter Crouch points out that if North held 6 hearts, E/W would not have stopped in 3@S. Yes, that sounds good.|pg||

nt|roswolf: see you in 5-10 mins approx|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: angry words in Norwegian. North leaves the table and the TD sits in to turn dummy's cards|pg||
