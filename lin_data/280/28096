pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|idc: Sensible at state of the match, not sensible in the normal order of things that is :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Goodman being overly cautious, his partner did make a free bid at the four-level|pg||
nt|idc: Specs asking about North's Dbl rather than 3@h overcall - I don't mind either in truth|pg||
pc|s9|nt|idc: but having doubled, I'd try 4@h over 4@c I think|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: I would, first time round|pg||

pc|c7|nt|idc: Which of course means that I would end up in 1@h doubled, heh|pg||
nt|idc: "wouldn't" I meant|pg||
nt|paulg:  i hate raising without three trumps, it makes competing so much more difficult|pg||
nt|idc: @dAxx is a bad holding in partner's suit for Mould to play for penalties|pg||
nt|idc: but again, he is trying for a swing from somewhere|pg||
nt|paulg:  also when partner has overcalled in a four-card suit the 4-2 fit tends not to play well|pg||

nt|vugraphzdu: it was suggested...|pg||
nt|idc: though he should be able to place spades by then|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought a diamond looked right, sort of endplays the defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  but Mould will win and play a low heart I guess when he sees Sime's length signal|pg||
nt|paulg:  or he may go for actually defeating the contract and switch to a spade|pg||

nt|idc: But in general it is important not to go too much into a shell when you are defending a decent lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think Mould would bid 4NT to show the minors when 4-6, so presumably 4NT must be natural|pg||
