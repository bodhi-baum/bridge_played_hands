nt|Gerben42:  2 more boards and things looking strong for Denmark|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  now you have 11 cards :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  but not a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|2H!|an|weak 2|nt|Gerben42:  which to be fair wasnt that easy to find|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  I open 2@H in S|pg||
mb|p|nt|docms: rather 3 suited|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  3@H 4@D p 5@D?|pg||
nt|docms: 4@D would be non-leaping Michaels for some|pg||
mb|3H|mb|5D|nt|Gerben42:  2@S is a hot bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  well done to EW getting them overboard|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42:  well thats on a finesse|pg||

nt|docms: actual difference 13 VP |pg||
pc|d7|nt|Gerben42:  East will now bid 6@D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Gerben42:  knowing from 4@H that pd is minimum so no chance of 7@D|pg||
