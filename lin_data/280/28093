nt|andyv:  dbl of 5@d may encourage E to take one more call|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, N's not raising may convince E that they have some defense against 5@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  question now would be if pass of 5@h would be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  on board 25, 3NT was not found in OR either and 5@d went down 1|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andyv:  and the match is tied|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  I think pass of 5@h is forcing here because pd doubled 5@d...if pd did not dbl 5@d, I don't think pass would be forcing.|pg||

nt|Henryb:  But in the event Topbridge has a better than 2VP lead, with each imp at this table worth about a fifth of a VP. So a 10 imp or so cushion|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|andyv:  as spec pointed out, you can't make 5@s on @c lead or @c switch|pg||
