pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|paulg:  surely Goodman won the first trick with the @dA?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  but he will be put to a spade guess for the contract|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Small problems at the start, operstors catching up...|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: Operator error! sorry Trying to catch up quickly|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think we can guess that Liz because Goodman never plays this quick|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  I could not possibly comment|pg||
nt|vugraphzdt: They started before I'd got the setup right|pg||
nt|paulg:  the advantage of E/W playing the hands is that you do stand a chance of catching up|pg||
nt|paulg:  Declarer will now play a couple of clubs|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|paulg:  EW play 2-way checkback, whatever that means|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  but I expect 2@c forces 2@d and now 2@h is invitational|pg||
nt|paulg:  of little interest to West though|pg||

nt|paulg:  i'm surprised that Murdoch did not continue with 3@d, but it's helped Sime find a poor lead for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|capercliff:	needs to go out twice to @h's|pg||
nt|capercliff:	8 top tricks|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|paulg:  Goodman unwilling to run the @d7 as Sime may have led from three|pg||
nt|capercliff:	needs to do it now at any rate|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|capercliff:	not the time to play the K|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|capercliff:  but it probably didnt matter|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think he'd be down if he ran the @d7 and it were @d108 doubleton in the South hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|capercliff:  he could have played the Q@d if North followed small then taken a double @s finesse|pg||

nt|Galadriel: He made that look easy|pg||
nt|Galadriel: I might still be thinking|pg||
nt|gipsona:  looks like good result from open room|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gipsona:  23 point 3N|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gipsona:  but E has similalrly seen the value of his red two suiter|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gipsona:  Ok so in open room e/w are playing 1@h on bd 26|pg||
nt|gipsona:  so imps for e/w and some upside on part scores hand to come may mean that lead reduces|pg||
nt|Galadriel: Oh, that hand is just too good not to open 2@C|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gipsona:  I have some sympathy - i hate opening 2@c on big two suiters (and would probably respond on e hand) but agree 2@c looks better|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|gipsona:  1@h + 6 is a fairly unique score:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark:  Last board in this room - first half complete. Second half starts at 16.00. Thanks to our commentators, Anne Martyn and Alex Gipson - and our indefatigable operator, Stephen Peterkin|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h2|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
