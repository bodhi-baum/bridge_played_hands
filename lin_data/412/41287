nt|serhat: guess -1 only|pg||
nt|game over: easiest is @d A @d Q spade, then he will get three diamond tricks and two spade tricks|pg||

nt|lokaty: in the other table the declarer has also lost 4@S, but then the defence was not right and 10 imps for Sweden again.|pg||
nt|game over: we've been very fortunate to see so many close matches (even in the QF)|pg||
