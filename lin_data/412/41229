nt|kit: If USA gets to something down 3, we have a tie|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Chick: EW must be in a state of shock right now|pg||
nt|kaoruzhu:  I'll personally search North Korean's King's phone No. and call and check if he needs some extra coal miner there joining his footable team.|pg||
nt|kit: likely 3NT by North I would think|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: now this could create real complications for N-S|pg||
nt|Harlan: This is one time (very) aggressive Hurd needs to slow down.  but, too late for that|pg||
nt|kit: What can South do but bid 4@C?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: you wish :)|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, 4 cl the last safe landing-place, but can the plane "land" ?|pg||
nt|kit: They now figure to get to 5@C, probably down 2|pg||
nt|Harlan: The real concern is if 5@C gets X, not if one of N or S bids it!|pg||
nt|stigw: Ending in 5 cl would not be bad, as long as it isnnt doubled and set 2 or more tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: I can't see where either East or West is going to find a double|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: Its 2 iomps at stake, so HU pought to double !!!|pg||
nt|Chick: I think E should double, knowing what just happened on the last hand|pg||
nt|kit: that is just one hand|pg||
nt|stigw: No, he didnt dare, so I think its ok for USA 2 now !|pg||
nt|shuster:  down 3 is a tie|pg||
nt|Chick: I guess it depends on how close he thought the match was|pg||
nt|kit: and East certainly doesn't want to give away the club position|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Not easy hand to play -- remember, he doesn't know his goal is down 2.|pg||
nt|Harlan: Only if E-W knew the real state of the match would they find a X.  Though BD 31 was truly a disaster for them, they don;t know how much USA2 has caught up for sure.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|stigw: Yes, al of you are right, and of course HU couldnt know the state of the maych (and obviously didnt have enough for a normal penalty double).|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|golfsquash: nice faLSECARD|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stigw: It might end up 3 down, making it a tie !!!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit: This could be danger if club to queen and club|pg||
nt|Chick: what happens then?   a playoff?|pg||
nt|shuster:  are there any tiebreaks?  Fractional carryovers?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 2 spade ruffs was a danger if he didn't play trumps.|pg||
nt|stigw: I really dont know - extra boards maybe, or total points ???|pg||
nt|sommer:  China won RR by big|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|kit: uh oh -- now I think he will be down 3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sommer:  they had 16 imps carried over|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pelu:  if a tie then 8 extra boards|pg||
nt|kit: assuming East finds heart shift, which shouldn't be hard considering no 3NT bid by North|pg||
nt|Harlan: I believe that was the max carry over.  They already received it.  So now extra boards|pg||
nt|kit: and 16 is max, so no fractions|pg||

nt|Harlan: Someone said it was a sudden death & not 8 BDs.|pg||
mc|9|nt|Chick: moot now|pg||
nt|golfsquash: academic now|pg||
nt|Chick: congratulations to USA2|pg||
nt|Harlan: so amazing!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|cicus: this is not official|pg||
