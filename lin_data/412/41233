nt|granguru:  this hand will cost Sweden another 10 imps probably|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if demuy had club 9, a club shift would make sense, but in actual case suit is either blocked or shift helps declarer|pg||
nt|granguru:  if W @s tenance has been a singleton @s6 then E best defense might be playing on @Cs..very hard decision|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then why did declarer duck|pg||
nt|kit: East needs to answer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in other words, demuy should get this right if he uses all the clues|pg||
nt|kit: Although maybe not so clear|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer wins spade lead (with 10xx) and goes after hearts, this gives defense time to shift to clubs while the spade still needs to be knocked out|pg||
nt|kit: So maybe declarer would duck, knowing that if East continues spades declarer is in great shape|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|kit: Declarer knows East has ace, since West didn't go up ace on club shift|pg||
nt|kit: And he knows West has 10 from play of 9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this sequence of club plays by west is surely a tell|pg||
nt|kit: So ducking this and the next club also pretty much has to work.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jkdood: Other room play 3N NS Bd 16|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: Due to entries, 4@H may be much safer|pg||
nt|zaXXon: 4@h looks makeble, 3NT not so|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s8|nt|jkdood: a low @H might have been an issue?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jkdood: At least it would look like a spade ruff could be stopped, but it wouldnt help as we see the @S and @H situation|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|zaXXon: second spade immediately looks best|pg||
