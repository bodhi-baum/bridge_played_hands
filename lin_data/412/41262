nt|odysseus69: 6 diamonds has problems- the luckier 6 spades OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 6nt fine too|pg||
nt|game over: yes, 6@d has entry-problems, you cannot cash the @s without risking diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|game over: and you cannot draw trumps and go back to West's hand safely (@h A is over the @h K)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4d coming|pg||
nt|barnets: but south gets squeezed|pg||
nt|barnets: in clubs and spades|pg||
nt|adonis18:  what about 6 sp?|pg||
nt|game over: I don't know their methods, but I guess 2@s was kind of a wide-range-bid which makes this sequence awkward|pg||
nt|game over: 2@s opening would have been a constructive w2 (9-12)|pg||
nt|barnets: on a heart lead v 6@D and heart back|pg||
nt|barnets: south is squeezed in blacks|pg||
nt|game over: so if West has 6@s he might be stronger; but if I remember correctly West opened it on an 8-count with 5332 (NV) so not sure where they draw the line|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure 4d now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what do we all expect?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|game over: if you are in 6@d you have two lines; the squeeze that Barnet mentioned or hoping that @s Jx is with short trumps); Barnet's line requires Jx or Jx as well, but is slightly better ...|pg||
nt|game over: because you don't need to have long diamonds / long spades in one hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|adonis18:  2sp rebid doesn't do justice to the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 6d now|pg||
nt|game over: perhaps it is equal|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|game over: (and both lines work here)|pg||
nt|aardv:  Robson may consider his line for some time in 6@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: I think dec is forced to make 6@D on a heart lead|pg||

pc|hT|nt|barnets: the def have to play a second heart|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|barnets: south bares his @CK|pg||
nt|barnets: in end |pg||
nt|game over: East could have corrected to 6NT; West likely only has a doubleton diamond (not totally clear) and then he can foresee entry-problems after the likely heart lead|pg||
nt|barnets: and dec has to guess|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good fale card |pg||
nt|game over: it is much easier to see this problem if you can look at all hands ;)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: trying to stop 2nd heart|pg||
nt|barnets: so if he plays a heart dec plays all his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: drops @SJ in end and guesses clubs|pg||
nt|aardv:  systemically the ten lead denies the jack|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think he will play club|pg||
nt|game over: they play Rusinov against 5-level or higher contracts|pg||
nt|aardv:  sorry, my mistake|pg||
nt|Psyck:  Is the squeeze line better than say playing for @s33 & @c finesse on?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do they jead 10 from J10|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|game over: no, drawing two rounds of trumps is better for this reason I think|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe a better line is @DK @SQ @DA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done - gives defence a chance|pg||
nt|barnets: and then 3 discards|pg||
nt|barnets: but that only works the way cards are so not clear|pg||
nt|game over: you win in one line if one opponent has Jx and either 3+diamonds or Jx and the @c K (or a finesse) - but those percentages are the same I think|pg||
nt|game over: but 3-3 and a finesse is a bonus if you cash @d K-A|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we all know club king is wrong but not so clear to Robson - so 3-3 spades and c finesse - not that i suggest that line|pg||

nt|Psyck:  Yes should be an exciting final segment|pg||
nt|Aurora:  Many thanks @H to all commentators- for sharing your experience with us. Our thanks to the operators and kibitzers, see you in about 20 minutes for the next session |pg||
nt|barnets: @CA lead will give 6@S|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|Psyck:  Leaping Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|Psyck:  @d suit and a major suit, usually about 8.5 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|nt|aardv:  i don't understand playing 4@D as leaping michaels here.  How's partner to know which major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Psyck:  4@h pass/correct|pg||
mb|4S|nt|aardv:  i like to play pass then 4@D over 2@H as leaping Michaels.  Of course, opponents may not co-operate|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: gold already in 6@S|pg||

mb|5C|mb|d|nt|Psyck:  not a cue that North is glad to hear|pg||
nt|barnets: @CA lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|Psyck:  this double is not likely to lead to a @c lead|pg||
mb|6D|nt|Psyck:  as the double shows @c length & W has length there too, @h lead most likely|pg||

nt|Psyck:  the final double is lightner|pg||
nt|aardv:  you can make on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|aardv:  declarer can set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: so the X cancels the club lead and asks for a diamond wich would let it thru also|pg||
nt|aardv:  So Robson needs to ignore both|pg||
nt|aardv:  possibly he can work that out, looking at his good minors|pg||
nt|aardv:  Robson doesn't think diamonds are 7-2, so no hurry to lead them|pg||
