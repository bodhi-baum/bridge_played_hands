nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|panja: @D7..the best bet for South|pg||
nt|barnets: he will get it right|pg||
nt|barnets: south went wrong earlier playing a daimond|pg||

nt|aardv:  england played sweden in the BB semi-final in 1987, Forrester was on the winning side|pg||
nt|shuster:  players taking their time here.  No one wants to spend tomorrow watching instead of playing because they played a card too fast|pg||
