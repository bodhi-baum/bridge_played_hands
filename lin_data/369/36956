mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2D|mb|d|an|T/O|nt|dburn: not sure why he doubled unless he's playing 1NT as a conventional overcall|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|an|Not Sure|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@d is often five cards in this kind of auction, so Robson hopes for a nine-card fit and raises to the nine-trick level|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|an|It was Penalties!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: but since no one can ever double anything for penalties any more, you don't actually need any number of trumps to bid to any level|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dburn: East has somewhat concealed the true nature of his hand, but this may not help very much - he can set up hearts, but South has an entry and the defence have five winners|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|dburn: still, the defence will need to mind its work - South has to play a spade when he gets in|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dburn: or at least he did, but declarer has gone for an obfuscating line and knocked out his own entry to the hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|nt|dburn: which will cost him an extra undertrick if the defenders are not obfuscated|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: and he may cost himself another one by putting up the queen when a diamond is played|pg||
pc|d4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: all of which means that West might have done a little better to pass out 3@d doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: Questions about carding NW playing standard smith|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: NS srry|pg||
nt|dburn: but in this kind of position it is possible for over-zealous defenders to return, say, the jack of diamonds to the queen and king, then continue the suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: The table may face a time penalty with two boards to play after this.|pg||
nt|dburn: North should not do that after South pitches a diamond, of course, but accidents sometimes happen|pg||
nt|dburn: the other table has finished, and McIntosh has picked up a swing on board 48 to trail by one|pg||
nt|dburn: Robson will be having a hard time believing that East really did knock out his own entry to the hearts - he will strongly incline to place East with @dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: I've been asked about the penalties.  There is a 3 imp fine to each team if they run over the time (5 past the hour in this case).  For each further five minutes there is another 3 ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: imp penalty.  Since neither team as yet called the TD to idicate that one side it more at fault than the other, the penalties will be equal.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzhg: However, if either pair is involved in slow play in the next stanza that penalty increases to 5 imps and the td can require that the offending pair be sat out.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: well, he played a non-jack diamond and East (reasonably) put the queen on it, so South needs to play a spade now to get the maximum (which will be worth 7 IMPs and not six)|pg||
