mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: The auction next door could be described as agricultural, but very effective. Afer north rebid @C south employed keycard, and north showed the queen of trumps because of the extra ...|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: length|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Enabling south to bid a grand slam.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Chick: S is still hoping for spade support, but when he doesn't get it, he'll head for slam too|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: 2@D is probably an artificial game forc|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I think it is just Forrester's way of setting @C|pg||
nt|Chick: ok.	I assume the 1@H showed spades, so any artificial game force would allow N to show spade support, too|pg||
mb|3D|nt|CopeyJ: Yes, right, and I think N has all but denied 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: but yes, Cornelia|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: so now Forrester has set trumps, a cue bid from Robson and probably keycard|pg||
