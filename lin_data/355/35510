pc|h7|pc|h2|mc|13|nt|petergill: Vital moment|pg||
nt|pelepele: and so they claim !|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: I think they are looking for extra boards so may be a tie. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think the rescore of Bd 20 from 180 to 150 was correct|pg||
nt|mrdct:  any idea what happens with a tie?|pg||
nt|paulg:  was the carry over exactly 5 IMP, could easily have been a fraction|pg||
nt|petergill: Match tied!|pg||
nt|paulg:  if it is a tie, then four board play-off|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: I think extra boards are played - a penalty shoot-out as we say in Scotland|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the correction on brd 20 was correct|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Paul|pg||
nt|pelepele: somebody night need to find the bbo file with the extra boards ! |pg||
nt|paulg:  of course BBO would not be able to show a carry over of 4.75 imps for example|pg||
nt|mrdct:  next time anyone tells you that overtricks aren't important at teams ...|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm hoping for 5.25|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or @hQ now|pg||
nt|petergill: Website has 41-41 as the score at http://www.commonwealthbridgescotland.com/match/rank2.php|pg||
nt|pelepele: if the extra boards are  going to be on bbo we will need to load up the files !|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i can't seem t find the link to the regs|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it was there earlier in teh week when i was trying to work out how te Qf draw worked|pg||
nt|petergill: Twitter from Scotland says we await developments|pg||
nt|petergill: Scotland on Betfair is about 4-1 against (i.e 20% chance) of separating from England|pg||
nt|mrdct:  which i think means "the regs didn't contemplate a tie so we'll need to make it up as we go along"|pg||
nt|mrdct:  personally, i think the easiest way to avoid this problem is to always have some decimal places in the carryover|pg||
nt|pelepele: no sudden death is best and be ready with extra boards |pg||
nt|petergill: At the break, Sime and Murdoch from Scotland lead the Open Pairs, with a pair from Malta running 2nd|pg||
nt|mrdct:  playoff boards are problematic when there is a short meal break, victory ceremony afterwards and players with flights to catch|pg||
nt|petergill: No slow play fine|pg||
nt|petergill: and a Final vs Scottish Presidents to play, when the winner of this semi is known|pg||
nt|petergill: I like the term "Scottish President", even if it's only a 20% chance of applying outside of bridge|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it does seem fairly amateurish not to have clear regs about tie splitting - but it wouldn't be the frist time that has happened|pg||
nt|petergill: C/f seems to be 4.5, not 5|pg||
nt|petergill: according to Eamon Galligan|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm quite bitter about non-existent tie splitting regs having been on teh wrong side of it a few years ago and missing out on GNOT finals as a result|pg||
nt|pelepele: and the website now|pg||
nt|mrdct:  well i do like the decimal place in the carryover - quite sensible|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so canada win 41-40.5 it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: Aus 40.5 Canada 41|pg||
nt|bebechira: i think Canada won|pg||
nt|pelepele: does the team have a captain ?|pg||
nt|petergill: Congrats to Canada|pg||
nt|petergill: and good luck to Canada in the Final|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but it is pathetic on the part of the organisers that this wasn't clearly stated in the regs|pg||
nt|petergill: Website has that info on it|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.commonwealthbridgescotland.com/match/rank2.php|pg||
nt|petergill: says 40.5 to 41, Canada won|pg||
nt|petergill: Makes up a little bit for about 20 years ago when Canada controversially lost to Germany in dissimilar circumstances|pg||
nt|petergill: Open Pairs scores with one session to go - 86 pairs - Iain Sime and John Murdoch (Scot) lead from Mario Dix and Margaret Parnis-England from Malta |pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all, Margaret has no plans to change her name to Parnis-Scotland|pg||
