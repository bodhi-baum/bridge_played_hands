nt|lazer: Good thing Gosney bid the spades first.  6S down on the trick 1 diamond ruff if West declares|pg||

nt|timb: 3NT would be a serious slam try in some partnerships|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|WesleyC:  in the other room, they avoided the ruff by never finding their spade fit!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|timb: The Clark team playedd 6S by West and North found the @D lead (no double)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Yes Tim  makes a good point. Once you have found your Spade fit: 3NT = slam try or no Club control|pg||
nt|timb: Lost 17 as Travis-Ginsberg bid to 6NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: This deal illustrates the value of transferring: but of course the void could be in the ther hand just as well|pg||
nt|lazer: Another approach is to raise 2NT to 4NT as invitation.  If accepting, just bid 4 card suits up the line till you find a fit.|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Actually, 2@h was GF 2-over-1 according to system card|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: But Warren you only remember the good results|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lazer: Not true.  It's the bad ones that really stick.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: That's an awful lot of bidding on a 10 count|pg||
nt|timb: I prefer 1@S:2@H to be more not game forcing but 2@C or a 2@D response to 1@H or 1@S is a game force|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: why is that Tim?|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: 2-over-1 players can always resort to forcing 1NT over 1@s|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|WesleyC:  another solution is to advance 1@S with transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: I want to be able to bid 2@H on the West cards over 1@S and pass 2@S if necessary - it's a more tractable style using a weak 1NT opening, though|pg||
nt|timb: Ouch|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: off the rails here-- what was Thomson angling for with 4@d ?|pg||

nt|timb: he needed both majors 3-3 after this lead|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  Not much of an excuse, to be frank.|pg||
