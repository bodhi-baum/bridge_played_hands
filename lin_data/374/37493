nt|bjacobs:  But here the diamonds don't come in, so it looks to me as if  this will all be on the play|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: OZ convention card just differentiates signals when lead is from partner vs declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Gosney thought diamonds might be running, so went for partner to hold the @HK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't see any qualifiers for leads in partner's suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha6: told you, the 8 and 3 of spades confused his partner greatly|pg||
nt|vugrapha6: I think 3rd's when you havent supported|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But no!  the high spade lead comes home to roost!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per CC   Ware had option of Top or Middle from xxx|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So this is a great hand ... West thought East started with a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  spade|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Thomson at the other table led @S3 ... and then a Smith signal (should E/W play them) should have steered the defence|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our EW also use Smith vs NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  Reverse Smith|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so @C3 [if not count]  says  i like @S  in context of the opening lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And as has been pointed out, if East had played @S7 on the second round, that would have worked also, as it turned out|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So it gets back to my earlier comment about signals ... defence is hard, and you need every signalling tool at your disposal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should make for an interesting postmortem|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the context of @S8 lead and presumably encouraging Reverse Smith  @C3	i think Wilkinson should get it right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S7 from Ware sure would make it easier|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well ... East could have held @CJ2 doubleton.  I see Wilkinson as essentially an innocent party in this|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  @CJ3 doubleton|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  @S8 then @S3 is really a West-killer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i forgot about @CJ3   as Bill and a few specs pointed out|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: it discussed these situations where you penalized opponent's even though neither defender held 4+trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: woolsey-stewart and boyd-robinson have extrapolated that philosophy into many competitive situations|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Fantoni - Nunes do it a lot, with their so-called "inverted double".  Basically, in these auctions, double shows specifically 2 or 3 trumps|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  On board 14, they couldn't have had that start to the auction, but if they had, South would double, and North would pull it.  Successfully as it happens|pg||
