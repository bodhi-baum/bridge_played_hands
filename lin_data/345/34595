nt|ritong: yes, the auction is rather unusual:)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Other table got to 5@H doubled; opening lead: @c Ace|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jkdood: I suppose 6@H was taking out insurance; in this case,	expensive insurance|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ritong: i would describe 6@h as excessive cautiousness|pg||
nt|ritong: very excessive|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other room declarer in 5@H misguessed spades, so the damage will be diminished greatly here|pg||
nt|jkdood: As both rooms will be minus NS|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jkdood: Maybe a good spade guess here will cause a push|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jkdood: Lall team is on a 34-0 run;	more if the spades are guessed wrong here|pg||
nt|ritong: they won t|pg||
nt|ritong: opener evidently has @sA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphzfd: here it comes|pg||
nt|jkdood: We have a 10-card suit coming up on Bd 47; so lets move along Shi :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: spoilers....|pg||
nt|ritong: i thinkit s raf J who is tanking|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it is, Jagniewski is thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: there s no gain in playing smoothly here|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows declarer knows he has the @sA so he considers if ducking might gain trick(s)|pg||
nt|jkdood: In that case, N could actually claim here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|shuster:	this is the only other one I've seen|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Vugraphzff: if they can key card in clubs.....|pg||
nt|shuster:  Would love to see south raise clubs here :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  "I had 10 of them, and you raised!"|pg||
nt|meargent: all north has to do is set @Cs as trumps then bid blackwood simple no?|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  N wants to show clubs, then RCKB for K of clubs.......and Aces.....|pg||
nt|meargent: of course EW might have a say|pg||
nt|shuster:  West does have a bit of a fit for East's suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|5C|nt|lrobb98:  5 clubs= a bit conservative here.....but may have another chance......|pg||
nt|shuster:  he'd like to splinter in spearmonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|meargent: NS will probably stagger into 6|pg||
mb|6D|nt|lrobb98:  W should keep bidding.....|pg||
nt|meargent: as should north|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|meargent: or south|pg||
nt|shuster:  if North passes, perhaps South calls 6NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  big opportunity for a pickup for Pan China here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i guess south just couldn't believe N was offering 7@C|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|shuster:  I'm not a believer in the forcing pass promising a control in their suit.  It comes up so often that the player in direct seat has extra offense and the other player has the control|pg||
nt|shuster:  it appears that I would get along OK with North in that thought.|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  Not the optimum spot for NS...in assess the blame, the 5 club bid stands out.......his partner opened, and he has 8.75 tricks.....|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think he was planning on being pushed to 6@C, his partner's free raise crossed him up|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  The Michaels bid by E worked wonderfully......shows it is a bidders game......|pg||
nt|shuster:  When holding the North cards, I'd think my primary goal would be to declare, even if it is at the wrong level.  I think 5@C was an effort to do so, even though it failed utterly.|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  N has more like 9.75 tricks....3/4 of the time will take 10......1/4 will take 9....approximately.....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  so on this auction, S knows N has, at most, 1 spade......|pg||
nt|shuster:  South knows his partner has a singleton spade|pg||
nt|shuster:  So I expect him to win the @HA and shift to spades|pg||
nt|shuster:  He'll think the @CK is an entry, so he won't try to cash it.|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  7 clubs in other room...easier with no bidding.....I actually thought W could jump more than just bidding 3 spades, gave N a chance.....|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: always interesting to see superlong suits, because there is no theory about them|pg||

nt|lrobb98:  it would not be ridiculous for N to X 4 hearts here, and keep leading trumps..yes, they can easily make, but close X's often work well...|pg||
