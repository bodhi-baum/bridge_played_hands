nt|ahollan1: possible benefits of canape include, but not limited to:	early identification of 44 major fit, able to hide longer suit helps declarer and makes overcalling a bit more dangerous|pg||

nt|ahollan1: because partscore bidding not necessarily as strong as in natural systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: canape  invented by Pierre Albarran   popularized in mid/late 1950s thru early 1970s  by Italian Blue Team|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: not sure why no table of the Wagar [women's KO] Semi-Final|pg||
nt|shuster:  sometimes by establishing your suit even when holding no entry, you gain tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: after Q1  Chinal leading in both matches	 of course  3 of the semi-finalists are teams from China  |pg||
nt|shuster:  although here, you might get finessed out of your club jack that way|pg||

nt|shuster:  assuming his partner's diamond lead is from length (There isn't much hope if it is short)|pg||

nt|shuster:  it wasn't enough time though.  This isn't a trivial hand|pg||
