nt|ahollan1: that gave viewers great opportunity to see how screens are used|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: and about procedures in the hallway, avoiding teammates, avoiding discussions|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = weak 2@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i bet their opening 2@H = Flannery|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: chip tiny handwriting seems to confirm.	and "2@S = good weak 2"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: printed copies of approved defense must be given to opponents   http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
mb|3D|nt|vugraphzfe: indeed cohen reading his cheat sheet before finding the 3@D card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the modern treatment is that 1st seat non-vul vs vul preempts guarantee 13 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: kibitzer brings water for martel and lee|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: if that	is modern, woolsey was ahead of the curve|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3 of the 4 districts represented in the semi-finals are from the western part of continental usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 4th - in the other match  is from florida|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone was right behind Kit -- pushing |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice 5@H bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: asking for @S control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [presumably]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: cohen scans the sheet to see if it mentions this situation, straightens the 3@D stack, nonchalantly grabs 5@h from the box|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strange to see Billy Cohen on vugraph playing with someone other than Ron Smith|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: peculiarities of GNT|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: district boundaries splitting up regular partnerships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they didn't play together in the USBC [trials] either|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lee gives up reading the sheet, throws  it on the floor, examines hiscards below the lip of the table, sets them down|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: reaches for box, gestures palm in the air|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: laughter.  lee: "I couldn't find it in the notes"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both options treat  (2@D)-3@D in very strange way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lee staring at the floor, nodding.  if he can read the printed defense from that distance, his eyeglasses must be superb|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: all four players here wearing glasses.  woolsey in long-sleeved dress shirt and	slacks, cohen in long sleeves anjd jeans, martel blue sweater and khakis|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: @s4 and @c6 separated from their kindred,@s4 briefly detached|pg||
