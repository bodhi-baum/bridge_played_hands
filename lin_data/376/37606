nt|dslee: This is a very interesting hand both to bid, reach and defend|pg||
nt|rv: with 5m+4@h 15-17, he prefers 1n opening since he has reverse in @h after 1m-1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rv: I subscribe to JM's theory on the above aspect|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|rv: 4@s much better contract than 4@h|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|dslee: I am little surprised to why CSM did not take any further action on 3@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: even 6@s is reasonable contract|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|dslee: 6@S has a good def- thats what I mentioned in the beginning of the deal - this is such an interesting hand in every aspect|pg||
