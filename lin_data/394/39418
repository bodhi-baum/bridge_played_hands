mb|d|mb|2C|nt|pef: double by branley showed hearts with diamond tolerance at least|pg||
nt|ahollan1: click on player name gives links to goodies like:	system summary form, convention card, pic, bio|pg||
nt|pef: bramley, that is|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pef: no values needed to bid in modern bridge, non-vul., at least :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pef: i bet he means 4n as quantitative, but I'm not sure|pg||
nt|pef: casen may not be sure, either|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: either way - he likes the 7th @C|pg||
nt|MrAce:  yes|pg||

nt|pef: i think krekorian would have cuebid a red suit first if he wanted to blackwood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it could be that he did believe it was QUANT but hedged with RKC response |pg||
nt|pef: seems like no good way to avoid my original fear on this hand at this point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can only know for sure if it now goes  5N-PASS|pg||
