mb|2S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not a very attractive weak 2, but things are going very much NS way and that is the time when we step on the gas|pg||
mb|3H!|an|not forcing|nt|marlowepi: here for example, EW may be talked out of a slam ... or even their game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without agreements, this is an awkward situation vis a vis reaching 3N (which is of course not the target on this deal, am onlymaking a general comment)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4C seems the bid in front of E's face ... even if a pair plays leaping michaels, it could hardly apply after a NF 3H by N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even 4C should be enough to propel EW to slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should just bid 6C, giving up on 7 looking at those spades (after 2S by S) and weak clubs|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: the long hesitation could potentially have created an ethical situation for W. here however i think he is in the clear to bid 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it should look to W as if E has a heart stop and is expectin g/hoping W has a spade stop, since N bid a new suit NF|pg||
nt|phil:  unclear what the hitch would be - but he can infer that partner does not have a balanced 18|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but surely E has at least one minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: so a stroke of luck for EW, as the slam fails due to 3-o clubs, and all suits are double stopped|pg||
