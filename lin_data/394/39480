nt|jdonn:  East's lead directing double is actually questionable to me, since he doesn't know which major he wants led. In these relay auctions, doubling a bid also can give the opponents extra steps to work with|pg||

nt|jdonn:  So this is interesting, I think the right play is to go up ace on the spade lead, unless you are just certain west needs the king to lead low|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Playing low risks east winning the king, if he could have it, and switching to hearts, then you better bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Playing ace allows you to attack clubs, with better chances than diamonds|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Maybe west did need the king to lead low, which would make finessing on lead just fine, but the risk is worth noting if he might lead low from 5 small or something|pg||
