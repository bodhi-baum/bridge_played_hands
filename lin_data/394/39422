nt|pef: at imps he wasn't going to bid at the 5 level to save a 650 vs. 500.  at mps, much better chance of working|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pef: north has a bit of a dilemma on what to bid if south bids 1nt|pg||
nt|pef: 2 of a major an overbid, that leaves pass and 2d|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pef: if lairs bids 2s, lehman has a pretty safe double having bid only 2d originally|pg||
nt|kriegel:  2@S doubled made in the other room|pg||
nt|pef: then south has to decide whether to sit or bid 3d.  probably 3d at imps|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Lair asked about the DBL of 2@s "It's cards, not penalty"|pg||
nt|pef: I think another reason to bid 3d is that you have too many diamonds and so little in the other suits.  you are probably going to struggle to beat it 1 vs 3d being an almost sure ...|pg||

nt|kriegel:  That's assuming they play in spades. 2NT (all pass) is a possible auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|junior: Sorkin is thinking that his partner is completely broke|pg||
nt|junior: trying to figure out how his lead can matter|pg||
nt|junior: one of the specs correctly points out that in 6N, if the diamonds break poorly, declarer can fall back on the spade finesse|pg||

nt|kriegel:  At least 5@D keeps a plus in hand|pg||
nt|kriegel:  (and a singleton spade, of course)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: last board of the evening.  this match has 60 more boards tomorrow|pg||
nt|junior: And sometimes you have results like this one-- 3N made and 3@d did not!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: thanks everyone :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|junior: we end with some more excitement|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|junior: a potential slam hand|pg||
nt|junior: 6@d and 6NT are excellent contracts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: hmm I think we skipped 29....|pg||
nt|junior: Each requires approximately 3-3 @d or the spade finesse|pg||
nt|junior: will E/W be able to diagnose the good fit?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: ok, I see what happened,  will fix it|pg||
nt|junior: East is starting to like his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|junior: Experts are very aware of where their queens are located|pg||
nt|junior: queens in partner's suits are good|pg||
nt|junior: queens in side suits are suspect|pg||
nt|junior: so the hand's value changes as the auction progresses|pg||
nt|junior: gosh|pg||
nt|junior: I'm shocked that West didn't try an invitational 4NT over 2NT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfg: Zia starts talking about his red wine|pg||
nt|junior: East had no idea in the auction that West hand more than 12-13 poinrs|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - they still had the club A to take, so he did make 4 - I should trust Hamman I guess :)|pg||
nt|ritong: unless 2NT denies 4@ss|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: I think they also play Flannery, so Ewon't have 4 @ss on this auction|pg||
