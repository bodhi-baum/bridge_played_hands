mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|chip: A (rather weak) strong C. Maybe intended as partly constructive (do have 7 tricks), partly as a psyche (to keep NS out of a vul 4M).|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ganz:  looks like both this and 2h ew would come home|pg||
nt|kit: yes.  When you have a 6-card suit and otherwise weak hand, better to contract for 8 tricks in your suit than 7 tricks in notrump.|pg||
nt|mradin: He should be able to take at least 7 tricks - 3c -3s and a heart.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Welcome also to Mike!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mradin: I am surprised hurd never bid- he is usually pretty aggressive. If not overcall then maybe balance|pg||
nt|kit: When East cashes ace of hearts and shifts, it will be clear hearts are 6-2.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mradin: he knows his partner has some values when they stop in 1 nt|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2-card RDBL has been seen a lot this week|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson held up 5 fingers and Kranyak nodded, so I guess 4 or 5|pg||
nt|ganz:  hi|pg||
nt|chip: 1D is 2+. DBL 4/5 spades (I think), XX is 9+ doubleton heart, 2N shows a better hand.	3H probably 1 too high.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|chip: kib notes 1H = 13 cards (my addition: many of them hearts).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: vs nebulous @D   Hampson 2@H would be @H & @S|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|chip: J of spades would work better than low, but S will win K and shift to clubs, setting up their 4 black tricks to go with setting trick in trumps.|pg||
