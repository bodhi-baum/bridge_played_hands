nt|kit: However, slam isn't very good.	In fact, anything above 4@H is in jeopardy.|pg||
nt|kit: If South can determine that North is 4-3-3-3 he will know to give up on slam.  But I don't know if that info is available in their methods.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: this is a hard table to do vugraph, long pauses during bidding, lightening play with cards not well shown|pg||
nt|phil:  so Kit - it seems the key here isn't aces and kings - its establishing the degree of fit in clubs - how can south probe for that? |pg||
nt|kit: I don't know what they play at this point.  But North has to know his 4-3-3-3 with bad hearts isn't so hot.|pg||

nt|phil:  interesting double of 1N|pg||
nt|kit: East passed not because he particularly thought he was beating 1NT but because at this vul the alternative looked worse.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: West thought his partner had something for the pass, and decided that the vul game was better than the penalty in 2@C.  A disastrous decision.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|phil:	and vulnerable to boot|pg||
nt|kit: Imagine looking at that dummy and seeing basically no tricks in 3NT doubled.|pg||
nt|phil:  maybe 2N instead of 3N would have salvaged the hand|pg||
nt|phil:  but its so likely your opponents are trying to steal at these colors|pg||
nt|kit: simply double 2@C looks normal to me.|pg||
nt|phil:  assuming its penalty - many play it as TO, but you can make a forcing pass just the same|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	Yes, you can trust that your pard understands the vulnerability too|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he will win a high spade in hand and lead a low diamond, hoping North has honor-doubleton.|pg||
nt|ritong: from his point of view south has not five hearts|pg||
nt|kit: Although with South having bid 2@C, I guess that is impossible|pg||
nt|ritong: so north has like 5431|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: So win and lead a club to jack?  That at least ensures a second club trick.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|nt|ritong: yes  accept the medicine and go down three|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	bit of a harsh punishment here, as he surely expecting at least a little something for the pass|pg||
nt|phil:  not a lot of IMPs difference between -3 and -4 vs a part score but you do what you can|pg||
nt|kit: right -- and sometimes funny things can happen at the other table also.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Gordon temporarily back in front by slenderest of margins|pg||
nt|phil:  agree Kenny, especially when South didn't ride out 1N x'd|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	so even if this not making, he didn't expect to be doubled and off this many|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|kit: Some relief from South's heart discard -- that's one trick the defense doesn't get.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|phil:  and JLall will have to pitch on the next two clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Now the big test -- does he ride the jack of diamonds, which could let him actually make if the hand is friendly.|pg||
nt|phil:  if he reads the layout he will abandon spades|pg||
nt|kit: he would have the entries for 2 club finesses (note how he saved the 2 of diamonds), thus taking 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, and 3 spades.|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	he must suspect from the earlier play in @ds and the bidding that the layout is NOT friendly|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is that the bidding indicates that the shape of the hand is what it is.|pg||
nt|phil:  if the diamond loses the defense claims 1700....|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	the opponents have misdefended by quite a bit if this is making, as they could have cashed 4@h tricks at least|pg||
nt|kit: All true, the evidence points that way|pg||
nt|kit: but we have seen misdefenses before.|pg||
nt|kit: and one hates to concede -800 when there is that slim possibility of making.|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	I'm a little surprised he put up the @c Jack|pg||
nt|phil:  surely North is 6=3=3=1 and the diamond hook isnt working - he would never pass with 6-4|pg||
nt|phil:  Platnick did not come in over 3@d on 23, so 11 more to Gordon|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	meanwhile, there is good news for the Gordon team OTHER than this board|pg||
nt|kit: It is hard to see how North can't have king of diamonds -- North did open, and South has shown inferentially with KQ of clubs and a heart honor.|pg||
nt|kit: So, it sems like just take club finesse and cash ace of diamonds is best.|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	yes, the evidence is so strong here, I think you have to play that way|pg||
nt|kit: And maybe if North does have a doubleton diamond it is KQ doubleton, and then he will make.|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	perhaps north 6322 with doubleton kq of @d|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	yes, kit, you just beat me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: declarer in no hurry to decide next play|pg||
nt|phil:  that gives South four clubs Kenny|pg||
nt|kit: North can't have 2 clubs -- South did bid 2C.|pg||
nt|phil:  and Kit...:P|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	which could have been a scramble?  Would south always bid 2@h if 1534?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dwyer apologizes, Lall " no problem, take your time, we have plenty of time"|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	yes, justin certainly has no problem being generous on this hand|pg||
nt|phil:  Im simple - when JLall passes 1N I think he;s balanced, and I would just bid 2@h|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	certainly that's likely, Phil, but @d finesse is only right if north has doubleton @d anyway|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	so you might as well take @c finesse, and play for best result if layout is as it actually is, while still giving you a small chance to make|pg||
nt|kit: if declarer does take the diamond finesse, he will probably have the honor of going for the biggest number in the trials (or close to it)|pg||
