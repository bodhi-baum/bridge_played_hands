nt|Vugraphzfb: Wolpert asks about Greco's card at trick 1 "likely suit preference if he knows you're ruffing"|pg||

pc|sK|nt|ritong: this flop is far from perfect	 wich is why lall did not raise btw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe   approximately 13 cards and values for a double in this auction|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Wolpert asks Hampson what his hand was and Hampson has to think for a moment before telling him. Getting late in the day|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chip: and late in the event.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|bjacobs:  who have, on WBF rankings been the  1 pair for at least the last 5 years|pg||

nt|chip: maybe 3 down on D back too.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: There are some very noisy children in the next door room and Hampson just went out to try to quiet them down and also closed our door firmly|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
