nt|ritong: clear mixup next room|pg||
nt|ritong: i have trouble imagining kranyak wanted to invite with 22|pg||
nt|game over: South is a passed hand, so he cannot have A and three Kings, but it is still possible that he has the @s K instead of the @d K (although less likely given his lenghts)|pg||
nt|game over: 6@c is a bit better than 6NT (looking at N/S hands only) because you can use your clubs as entries to the South hand and establish a heart if they were 4-3|pg||
nt|game over: on the other hand, if South has @s K and @d K then 6@c is a very bad contract|pg||
nt|ritong: i hope he s not considering 6@c as some sort of @s fit|pg||
nt|game over: I don''t think South will bid 6@c with the @s K though (and missing the club king opposite at most three cards)|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: when you bring in this sort of contract, you know it s a good day  holy cow|pg||

nt|game over: a spade is suggested by many kiebitzers, I don't like it, but that is just a gut feeling|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wooldridge has been pulling diamonds out; Cayne had to go to the bathroom, but Wooldridge still not quite ready to lead|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|game over: the idea behind the club lead is that WEst might have a low doubleton club (if he has Kx or Qx a later club return could work as well) and then you can give him a ruff |pg||
