mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Perhaps they play 5-card majors and the opening on four hearts is just because it is in the third seat.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|BroLucius:  It's a splendid fit but the 4-1 trump break is unwelcome.|pg||

nt|georgia19:  now trump...|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Normal for East to play suit-preference when a singleton appears in the dummy.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Declarer must decide which hand to take ruffs in. Could possibly set up the spades.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Now scores the last two (big) trumps separately. great board. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|BroLucius:  4@H better contract than 2@C, for sure. We cannot see the bidding from the Closed Room unfortunately.|pg||
