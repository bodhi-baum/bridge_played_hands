pc|c6|nt|hackenbush: you can have well-defined 2-way new minor forcing auctions over 1nt, and 1@c-1@h-1@s can then show 5 clubs by inference|pg||

nt|debrose: The TD is also the vugraph operator.  An experienced W would know not to bid in this stuation, since he is likely to get ruled against if it is winning, and will keep his result if ...|pg||
