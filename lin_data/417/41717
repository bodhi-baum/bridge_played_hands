nt|debrose: "half" because the first segment was 14 boards, while this will be only 12 due to time constraints|pg||
mb|4S|nt|debrose: Ling-ling Zhang and Joshua Wang were on the winning Stanford team in the 2014 Big Game, and also took 2nd place ACBL Collegiate bowl this past summer in Chicago|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|debrose: Lu and Rosenberg are Berkeley undergrads, playing together for the first time.|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|jchiu: double is fine, but such a fast pass suggests Edward wasn't on the same wavelength|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hackenbush: on the other side, it's important to realize that the double is cards-oriented, not penalty, and that partner usually has 6 clubs|pg||

nt|hackenbush: this might result in 2@h by NS|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Oh boy... is west calling because transfer was announced on the 2@D bid?|pg||
