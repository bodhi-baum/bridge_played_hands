mb|p|nt|MiroManev:  smolen 3@h by E|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|Henryb:  No, David: at least here a transfer followed by three of the other major is a slam try in the transferred major|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: note that playing a weak NT it is not neccessarily right to keep the 1N opener as declarer, in fact often the opposite|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: TD called. Some problem with N and E who are on far side of screen, so I dont know what happened|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: May be Smolen misungerstanding, but I am guessing|pg||
nt|Henryb:  For what its worth I don't think it is necessarily important playing strong NT. Sometimes it is just as useful to conceal the distribution :)|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I will have a guess that Myers meant to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: and has bid 3@S and wants to know if he can do anything about it|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: that would be my guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Thats what I surmise too|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Players and TD are whispering so that there's no UI to S and W who are on my side of the screen|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Sensible.|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: W and S are trying to identify what the pianist is playing. Some rag, but we dont know which one|pg||
nt|Henryb:  You are quite right as to Smolen, David.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  1N-2H-2S-3H is a slam try in spades, not spades and hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: Rob Sheehan talking about the 30-pound-sterling game at TGR's. He says he prefers rubber|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: I would love to know what 3@S *actually* showed|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: because if it showed 5@H 4@S fg as per smolen, then 4@S should be a control for @H|pg||
