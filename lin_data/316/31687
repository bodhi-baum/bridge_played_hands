nt|runnerup:  maybe even 9 here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|CopeyJ: Would you invite with the E hand opposite 1NT (strong)?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  but 7 made in other table|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I guess it is appealing as 4@h may well be good|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: vulnerable at teams scoring|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not at pairs - at teams there is the vulnerability to consider|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I thought EW played Weak NT, maybe not in 4th or did sheehan downgrade (unlikely)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: It is 12-14|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Shortage of entry to the dummy - we can see that the easy route is to lead low clubs from hand...|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: surprising downgrade, agree W hand isn't great with AQ tight @D but does have T@H and some @S intermediates|pg||

nt|CopeyJ: all Butland has is a jack in partner's suits|pg||
pc|cT|nt|CopeyJ: and they are not vulnerable... Reardon would have accepted anyway of course|pg||
