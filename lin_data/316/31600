nt|panosk:  i wouldnt have bid 2@S, but wd Gold|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lose 10. But they were scheduled to lose 6 anyway, so the 5@S bid only "cost" 4 imps|pg||

nt|mdgraham: another example of the Allfrey team bidding (2@H) where their opponents passed|pg||
nt|panosk:  i dont much like 2@H with this hand, but he was 4th non vul and 1@S might have been garbage, so, there is some logic in it |pg||
nt|mdgraham: think W might have doubled 3@C? |pg||
