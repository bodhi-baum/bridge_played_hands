mb|p|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzcv: EW 4M, strong NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: modern trent is to open 1 NT (previous hand ) but 1 @H results much better|pg||

nt|panosk:  *aspirations|pg||
nt|sybarra: weak 2 in one of majors,  pard just does not know which one |pg||
nt|mdgraham: that probably wasn't what West expected|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 7 stays difficult (as usual)|pg||
nt|panosk:  5NT from W?|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about 4 @H?|pg||
nt|panosk:  well after spades is mentioned , not now|pg||
nt|panosk:  yes 4@H seems right to me too|pg||
nt|sybarra: I meant 4 @H by W |pg||
nt|bobholl: west migth think they have a @H loser in other room unlikely|pg||
nt|panosk:  of course|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I doubt if 3H is a transfer - probably just a Qbid |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Bob |pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: I think 3 @H was pick something,  I have 2 places to play |pg||
nt|panosk:  and game forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: just bid 7 now |pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: or should he be afraid of ruff?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done|pg||
nt|bobholl: (very) well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panosk:  no he will make a grand slam try, i think, something like 5nt or 6@H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panosk:  he should make, i should have said|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 3 @H was "do something smart pard"  other interpretation |pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ace of spades first, of course - can pick up 4-0 break either way round |pg||
nt|sybarra: think we can claim now |pg||
