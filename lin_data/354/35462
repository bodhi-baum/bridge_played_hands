nt|vugraphzft: North says it's a bit awkward|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West says call TD if N likes, but West is just thinking.|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, depending on the regulations pulling a bid from the box is the same as making the bid when they are not playing with screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: TD says if bid cleared the box he must repeat|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2 players didn't see it, but all agreed cleared the box|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|paulg:  this looks like the bid he should have made :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: so that bid now made|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:	so it is clear to Bakhshi that McIntosh wanted the @sQ to bid slam (he could not realistically have more key cards)|pg||
nt|paulg:  so he is entitled to bid on if he thinks it is right, there are no ethical problems here|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: West passes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  As we can see, it would be a good time to bid on, but realistically it is a real gamble and not one to make at this point of the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: after 2N enq, then 3@s would be min, and other suit shows feature|pg||

nt|paulg:  2NT will be 15+, forcing to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: *typically |pg||
nt|paulg:  i would say that 95% of UK club players play it|pg||
nt|paulg:  practically none of the international players (apart from some in Wales)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I think 5 card majors more typical internationally |pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't understand why Ratcliff is thinking here, he should have thought of his rebid before opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|paulg:  a slow 2NT just conveys so much unauthorised information|pg||
nt|sybarra: and does he really want to bid 3 @C?   or 2 nt with Jx? |pg||
nt|paulg:  and any slow rebid just says I am surprised and not happy with my rebid|pg||

nt|vugraphzft: Was fairly swift 6N from South - my network failed|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: N has wide ranging 15-19 said South, so 2N forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost cant blame S  |pg||
nt|paulg:  no, the slam is no worse than 50-50 and could have been better|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told that north's 2NT was in tempo and it was the connection that caused the delay|pg||
nt|paulg:  nevertheless, hopefully some of kibs will appreciate why you need to bid in tempo on such auctions|pg||
nt|sybarra: somedays the K of @D sits right |pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 2N rebid in tempo - I think he had 15 hcp yes?  So would had recided his rebid options before opening 1@s surely? |pg||
nt|sybarra: it could even be kx (or k10)    on good days|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: My laptop is lagging a bit when internet connection dips, so my tempo may be more uneven than that of players.  Waiting for East now tho|pg||
nt|paulg:  the danger with McIntosh winning the ace of clubs is that it might rectify the count for a squeeze on his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzft: 18 mins left says TD|pg||
nt|paulg:  he is also considering what to switch to if he wins it|pg||
