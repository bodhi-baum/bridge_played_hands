mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: south doubled because he was too good for a 1NT overcall, i imagine|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: but whatever he did he was in trouble - 1nt would probably have been doubled|pg||
nt|vugraphzdr: 1 NT from north shows 0-5 HP|pg||
nt|athene: not sure if NS have some specific agreements about 1nt as a scramble in this auction, or whether Bank was just improvising|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: i think north would have been much better-off to redouble, rather than bid 2@H, anyway|pg||

nt|athene: if 3@S was clear heart agreement south could bid 4@C and that would do the trick|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: if 4@C was a stronger slam try south should have chosen that since he was right on the borderline of an opening bid|pg||
mb|d|an|4 major + 5+ minor|mb|p|nt|athene: double 4M 5+m i assume|pg||

nt|athene: south had lots of ways to reach 3@C - bid it right away, bid 2@C (p/c for minor) and then 3@C over 2@D, or bid 2@D then 3@C|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|nt|athene: you have to discuss what they all mean|pg||
nt|athene: logically 2@C then 3@C should be weaker|pg||
