nt|woozle:  The point has been made, intelligently, that south might win the second club and switch to a heart if he lacks the diamond queen. That's good expert defense, although it might occasionally help declarer choose which red finesse to take|pg||

mb|2C|nt|nilsland:  North solved the H problem|pg||
nt|woozle:  With two club stoppers, I don't mind showing the exact range with 1NT...majors will often find themselves later anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not if partner passes 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2MA could be much better|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle:  In that case I'll probably make 1NT....1NT has to fail for 2M to be meaningfully superior|pg||

nt|nilsland:  East want to bid - but WHAT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle:  East might have bid 1H while he had the chance, notwithstanding north showing the suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Lille August 2012|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: still got to 3NT  after all that|pg||
nt|pelu:  but S was right: they dont know to bid scientific :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: They have no agreement if 3@H shows fragments or ShS|pg||
nt|woozle:  I've said it before and I'll say it again - shortage showing bids are good...if north can pinpoint the short hearts, south will never pick 3NT|pg||
nt|woozle:  West might as well lead his hearts...his partner passed over 1C and can hardly have a strong suit to find|pg||
