mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|roswolf: yes but nv i doubt they will bid it -3nt more likely?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|roswolf: might well make but this is not straightforward to defend|pg||
nt|eamongall: still need that @S guess I think |pg||
nt|roswolf: 6 rounds of @d will be uncomfortable|pg||
nt|eamongall: but run 6 @Ds on the way maybe|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|yorkbeach:  a spade misguess is likely to lead to the loss of (3 or 4)@c and 2@s|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  results for the 2 matches to date are at http://www.wbu.org.uk/Int/2013/SeniorsCamrose/SeniorResults.pdf|pg||
nt|roswolf: effectively n/s need to throw @h to keep the @s position obscure|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on the bidding it was slightly easier for South to enter the bidding than it was for North|pg||
nt|roswolf: not easy and certainly counter-intuitive|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so slighlty more likely that North has the @sA|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|pc|dA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yorkbeach:  for example, if South has both top clubs and the @sA, surely he would have X 1@d or overcalled|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt by west?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  6@c by West impossible after the opening|pg||
mb|2H|an|kokish|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but i fancy they will play in @C|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yorkbeach:	but 6Nt needs the @h to run|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  so 6@c the better practical shot, even if theoretically inferior|pg||
nt|eamongall: this would be a type of hand we done in the gym .. singeltons ..voids .. interference bidding |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  as North did not X 2@d, EW may make 6@c if they simply bid it|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well 6@c is essentially 50% and 6nt is well below that|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: one would go for @D or @S lead .. and West bid @Ss but not naturally |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  6NT needs hearts 3-3 or the jack doubleton plus may need clubs not 4-0|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  the reason the 4-0 @c break might beat 6Nt is that a heart lead would leave declarer stuck in dummy|pg||
mc|13|nt|roswolf: imo the @d lead should have been found i recommend leading the 4 card suit rather than the 5 card suit simply because there is more cards for pard to have|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  North may try a tactical underbid |pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|nt|yorkbeach:  trying to get himself pushed into 4@h so that EW do not save|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bids honestly|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf: judgment now at a premium|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  make South's @sA the @sK and 5@h could easily go down|pg||
nt|eamongall: We don't get scores from other room because the rooms are not linked |pg||
nt|roswolf: it is surely right to bid on|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam is not far off|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  then again, not getting rich against 4@s X|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: they need to close closed room and reopen and broadcast from other side of match|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have adopted the half-a-loaf policy|pg||

nt|eamongall: the expert opperator Harold tells me 29-17 win for Ireland .. I thought a little closer .. as thought scotland had at least 20 imps |pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 8 imps and whatever the result of board 7 claim was |pg||
