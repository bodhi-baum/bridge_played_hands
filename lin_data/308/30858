mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2H|nt|BroLucius:  So, 6 behind but a couple of possibly good boards still to be compared for Lavazza.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  2@S via a redouble shows the West hand OK.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|BroLucius:  Might be on only 2 spades, I suppose.|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Yes, he bids 3@S.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|BroLucius:  Did not bid 2NT in previous round, so shows only 3-card support.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  A double of 2@H would have picked up 500 but too dangerous on those West cards, with 3-card spade support.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|BroLucius:  Seems that declarer can find 10 tricks here by making a second diamond trick.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  But if he ruffs a club, he will lose a trump trick.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Perhaps he can make the @HQ.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|BroLucius:  He goes to set up the diamonds first.|pg||
nt|medwards: Time is on declarers side|pg||
pc|d5|nt|BroLucius:  Bocchi hopes for the best!|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Yes, now he can ruff out the other top heart.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|BroLucius:  And, what is more, expect that the opponents will not bid this game.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Did he need the @D8 as an entry without this club return? No, because South would then have had to play a heart instead, it seems.|pg||
mc|10|nt|medwards: Also did not unblock diamonds|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  No, he could play a trump.|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Zia broke to 4@S at the other table and East took an age to bid 4NT.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  4@H re-transfer and 5@C a cue-bid|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure whether Turbo in operation for this pair|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Well done.|pg||
nt|dburn:  curious auction - no one cue bid a first-round control, but there were three cuebids of second-round controls|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, West knew East didn't have @dA, or he would have bid 4@d and not 4@h|pg||
nt|ady: flat board   so a decent win for Lavazza|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  With trumps 2-2, two diamond ruffs bring the total to 12, but declarer will spend some time considering less helpful breaks.|pg||
nt|ady: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzeh: Sementa would have been in trouble should he have to bid first round control :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|BroLucius:  Zia looks for a descriptive rebid.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  If he bids 4@C (cue-bid with good spades), East coudl retransfer with 4@H on a bad hand that wanted to stop in game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Now East is close to a slam.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Two diamonds ruffs give an easy 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Eats may be dubious about the @DQ, but the two black queens are known to be good values.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|BroLucius:	If East is not happy to bid 4NT, he can bid 5@C. Well, he has bid 4NT, at last.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
mc|12|nt|BroLucius:  But Zia and Jansma have fought back strongly on the last few boards.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The @CJ falls in two, of course, so another diamond ruff is not needed as it happens.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Jansma is calculating if he can draw anopther round of trumps.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The good 600 was worth 7 IMPs.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  They took 300 off 2@H doubled at the other table.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Looks liek play may have finished here. 980 has been scored up. We can jump to the other room now.|pg||
