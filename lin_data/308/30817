nt|petepunt: surprised they don;t X with 4+@H playing transfers - tho i would pass with West|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|paulg:  yes, it is strange that they don't play transfers here, given you can retain and reuse your original structure|pg||
mb|3S|nt|petepunt: Souths had has many faults despite high pt count,|pg||

nt|petepunt: e/w still have a very good chance to make the team,  if they can avoid a big loss here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: director called|pg||
nt|carrott: and E/W both have two Camrose weekends each, but not as partners|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: query over explanation of 3@s|pg||
nt|petepunt: some questions over the 2N and 3@S bids|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: alerted one side of table but not other|pg||
nt|carrott: but they were both made and explained by North|pg||
nt|carrott: Sorry,not the 3@S. Question here is should East have doubled|pg||
nt|petepunt: tactical call to buy time as n/s were on a roll ! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: 3@s sometimes shows a shortage but South did not alert because he actually had spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: North thought his @sKJx were facing a shortage, which is why he bid only 4@d|pg||
nt|carrott: the event is being played with screens, so North & East are the same side, so North is explaining bids to East|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's hard to see how this affects anything, potential misinformation but no damage|pg||
nt|carrott: I agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzds: yes - director is coming to that conclusion |pg||
nt|paulg:  although it seems strange to have a bid to show shortage in the fourth suit at the three level|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|paulg:  as 1NT is not as wide-ranging playing a weak notrump as it would be playing 2/1|pg||
