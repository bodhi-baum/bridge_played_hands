nt|game over: a nice "8" NT to start with|pg||
mb|4D|nt|game over: I don't know their system but probably 4@d shows diamonds|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: hi all|pg||
nt|game over: if South takes control and asks for key-cards they will easily reach 7NT (if two key-cards are missing, slam might be good but hard to reach)|pg||
nt|game over: hi Dennis|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an| |mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|uni_dennis: 5NT and S can count 13+ tricks|pg||
nt|game over: 4@h = CueBid, 4NT RKCB, 5@H = two w/o (guess)|pg||
nt|game over: if South has a positive hand, North knows that 7 @d is usually at worse on a finesse|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: this is the final of the cavendish teams tournament|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the pairs tournament will start tomorrow, auction is tonight|pg||
mb|p|mb|7D|nt|game over: @s AQx @h KQJ @d Jxxx @c AQJ being an exception, but this is one hand out of a million|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: 7N by south now to save 2 imps|pg||
nt|game over: I think South will correct to 7NT|pg||

mb|3H|nt|uni_dennis: can you get some useful information from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: you need to lead a heart to defeat 5@h|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: mcGann just gambled 6@h in the other room, after N bid 3NT at some point|pg||
