mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be interesting|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yorkbeach:  yes there will be some boards where players get a good or bad score due to results elsewhere|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: nuilderberg 2 suited weak 2!?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but playing 200 in all so plenty of time to skill to predominate over luck|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petepunt: y,  if two pairs sitting same way have bad sets the 'not-guilty' pair at the other table suffers more.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w have won te auction methinks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@h = 5@H = 4m|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  5@h+4m|pg||
nt|petepunt: 6@C is a make.|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@c would be more attractive for North if West didn't hold a 4-card minor|pg||
nt|petepunt: no just 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|paulg:  worried that his partner is sitting there with six spades to the jack or the like|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough bid - would liek to !X as 4@C shows 5.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: what would double show here!?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now to find a lead :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|carrott: North thinking about bidding, but West will probably have Clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|petepunt: eithe 3+@S  or a better hand with 6-4 -  very close call.|pg||

nt|roswolf: i think i would|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|dK|pg||

mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|petepunt: showing no slam interest and a re-transfer,  then 4@S.	|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  the key to their sequence is that 2NT is not required to show a normal 17-19 balanced, as a 1NT rebid shows this.|pg||

nt|paulg:  they can also double 1@c-(P)-1@s-?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  but these downsides are very small compared to the benefits if you are prepared to put in a lot of work|pg||
nt|roswolf: essentially why precision clubbers are now a rare breed - once people learnt to get busy in the auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  but none of the Italian world champions play them any longer|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|paulg:  normally North would show a spade single-suiter without three hearts now|pg||
nt|paulg:  so for me 2NT is almost any hand without 3 hearts|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: 3nt by south is a triumph|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:	3@c asks and 3@h would show spade-single suiter|pg||

pc|h2|nt|paulg:  with soft values and a notrump look to the hand, he may have decided to only show five spades (or they may have changed this last bit of the system)|pg||
