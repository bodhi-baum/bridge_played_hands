mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't believe 1N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is too strong.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely 1@C|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  when bal can have ANY 5-card suit [even (542)2@C when out of range for NT opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts  1NT  17-19|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N not 4@H but as you see  can have 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good time to sign off with this lie.|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|game over: even 5NT is not safe, although you can make it by playing a diamond to the king and stripsqueezing West in the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5NT = You make the final error, partner.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: no long suit	  assume not 44@S   so south hand looks to me to be too soft for bidding over 4N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which she did :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: still not worst slam you've been in --- single dummy  [i.e. not looking at EW hands]|pg||
nt|game over: 6NT needs the @s K onside and then you should probably play a diamond to the 10 (if the spade jack has not appeared)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: It looks like West was thinking, not South (they play with screens, S/W are on the same side)|pg||
