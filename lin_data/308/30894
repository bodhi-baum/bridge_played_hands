mb|2D|mb|p|nt|game over: EW can make 4@h due to the lucky heart position|pg||
nt|pelu:  NS sold for 57.000 Euro - highest price and EW as No4 for 34.000|pg||
nt|pelu:  2@D : 10-13 - remembver that ALL openbings on 1-level = 14+ for NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|game over: N/S don't need no introduction, no. 1 and 2 in the world rankings, very successful; EW are Germany's top pair, No. 3 in the second last (?) World Pairs, and a lot of other high ...|pg||
nt|game over: finishes in Nationals and international tournaments|pg||
nt|medwards: Four hearts is almost impossible to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|game over: I think they will bid it now, although it is a poor contract (West might think about 3NT)|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: True|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|game over: their meaning of the 2@c opening changed a bit over the years; first they played it as 5+@h and another five-card(+) suit, weak, then as a weak 2@d or 18/19 NT (I think), now back ...|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|h8|nt|game over: it is suggested that East took 1@h as a transfer bid, that's a reasonable explanation|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|game over: some pairs do indeed change the meaning of the 1@h and the 1@s bid|pg||
nt|pelu:  59 rounds of 2 boards will be played - then the field will be devided in 3) or 4) groups|pg||
nt|pelu:  prob the Operator soon will find out that its NS playing 3@s :):)|pg||
nt|game over: looks like declarer might escape for down 1 here (he will overruff, @d K, @d ruff and can get a spade in the end with a guess)|pg||
nt|game over: sorry, was too busy thinking about what was going wrong, don't know how a heart contract would have fared|pg||
nt|pelu:  total 60 pairs and IAF - IMP acroos the field|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|game over: 6@s can make on a good day, but not today|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|game over: 2@d = GF (guess), 2@h = relay, not natural (guess), 4@c = Splinter, 4@d / 4@h CueBids (guess)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|game over: I think, East should bid 4@s here (if 2@d is a GF opening), he has no extras|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|game over: instead of 4NT|pg||
nt|pelu:  looks like East total lost control of the bidding - 5Nt sh promise all 6 keycards|pg||
mb|7S|mb|d|nt|game over: oops, a RKCB misunderstanding?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: note that North did not double any previous bid, he is slightly indifferent to what his partner leads|pg||
nt|pelu:  not to expect on this level|pg||
nt|game over: can be, but before we blame East here, maybe they have an agreement about the strength of a 4@c bid (and West could have misanswered the ace ask) - we don't know for sure|pg||
nt|pelu:  D could ask for @h-lead - first suit bid in dummy|pg||
nt|game over: well North could have doubled 4@c (probably for a diamond lead) and 4@h and then 5@d ... :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|game over: many pairs play that a double of a splinter bid asks for a lead in the lower remaining suit (this is a better treatment than a lead in the higer remaing suit because you are more ...|pg||
nt|game over: likely to be able to bid the higher ranking suit; tiny advantage though)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|s3|mc|12|nt|game over: if 2@h is a Relay and not natural, they won't diagnose a heart fit, so 4@h XX is not a real danger|pg||
nt|pelu:  so still 300 for Ns - but tehre will prob be a nummer of -50 for EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|pelu:  Operator did he play small @h from dummy|pg||

nt|game over: now a strong pair from Bulgaria|pg||
nt|game over: 2@h = both majors, 2@s = preference it looks like|pg||
nt|pelu:  I exp that 2@H = both majors|pg||
nt|game over: X = aggressive, could lead to a making 3NT by N (with a good guess in spades)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|game over: the simplest defense is to establish the @s Q for North (two clubs, one diamond, two hearts and the @s Q)|pg||
nt|pelu:  not killing defense but sh still go down|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|pelu:  @CA and 3 x @h will do thge work|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|game over: N/S play Slawinsky leads, so a low club from South says odd with honour or even without honour (maybe he played @c 6-5 not 5-6)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu:  a   bridge-match with no results are like "kissing your sister" :)|pg||

mb|4H|nt|game over: EW play Precision, 1@s = @h (guess)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|game over: well maybe not given the 4@h bid ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: I am told 1@s = spades or 8-9 bal|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|pelu:  conditions of contest: Scores will be posted at the end of each round of two or three boards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|game over: this could be down on a diamond ruff (not now) and 5@d could be down on a heart ruff (in half the cases), so 5@d is a abetter contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|game over: well, from an EV point of view, 5@d and 5@h are close, 5@d is marginally better I think (like 0,6 IMPs)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bt:  nice east hand here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bt:  2 losers, I would expect a norwegian pair to be in slam here|pg||
nt|bt:  ;)|pg||
nt|game over: but only in hearts ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  partner never supporting spades should be a deterrent|pg||
nt|bt:  good stop|pg||
nt|game over: can you make 6NT after a club lead? I don't think so|pg||
pc|d2|nt|game over: well a squeeze never works because North sits behind the menaces, but double-dummy North must be careful to keep his spade|pg||
nt|bt:  a norwegian slam is supposed to be on 2 finesses, a 33 break and finally a squeeze|pg||
nt|game over: otherwise South can be endplayed in spades|pg||
nt|bt:  this one is way too good actually|pg||
nt|game over: I wonder what 3@s would have shown (instead of 3NT), 3@s = 3-card-heart support?|pg||
nt|bt:  its easy to imagine ew getting too high here: 1@S-2@D and its off to the races|pg||
nt|pelu:  no he has 9 toptricks even if the majors dont behave|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bt:  i predict more than half the field will get to slam|pg||
nt|pelu:  Mathias 3@S would - as in bridge :) - just be a prefernce in major|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bt:  any bets?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hJ|pc|s3|nt|medwards: Was the lead a small diamond?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pelu:  what happen in trick 1?? didnt he take with @d10????|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bt:  in this sequence you should play 3@H to be 55+ and then 4 in corresponding minor as a good raise|pg||
nt|game over: I understand why West bid 3NT with both minors well stopped; but some (good/old) pairs do play 3@s as three hearts|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|game over: I don't think this happened, likely he won the first trick with the @d 10|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu:  I have never heard that before|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|bt:  I think norwegians play 1@S-1NT; 2NT as a strong bid without 55+|pg||
mc|11|nt|bt:  many norwegians|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|game over: the book is called "Helgemo's world of bridge" by GEir Tislevoll|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bt:  very nice book, despite its origins ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: X = 4+@s, 1@s = probably exactly three spades|pg||
nt|bt:  one educated guess is that ew plays some kind of weak 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bt:  it is impossible to find a club switch now|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|bt:  and most players now how to handle this spade suit|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

nt|pelu:  I remember when EC pairs in Poland - rsults after every 2 boards - and we could find every pairs score board pr. board - this is closer to a drop in in your local club , sorre to say|pg||
