nt|bt:	the irish in the other room bid the ns cards to 2@S|pg||
nt|paulg:  Perhaps they play 2@c as limited 5-4 and 2@d overcall as decent 5-5, as some Italians do?|pg||
nt|bt:	isnt it normal on ireland to have at least one more trump than the opps, when you commit to a suit?|pg||
nt|eamongall: No No .. Ireland have had David Burn over for a training weekend in the past ... so Burns Law ...one less than the opps :) |pg||

mb|r|nt|bt:  it worked for the irish, so why not? :)|pg||
