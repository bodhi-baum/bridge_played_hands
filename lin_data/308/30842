mb|p|nt|ritong: but east should run|pg||
mb|1D|nt|SFoxa:  do hope. EW are long term partnership, such kind of agreements they have, for sure|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pelu:	1NT now sh show Ss hand|pg||
nt|ritong: north idea is, i m not sure to beat that but -180 or so is not the end of the world|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: when anything else than 1@c can be awful|pg||
nt|ritong: now, north has shown like 19/20 balanced|pg||

nt|SFoxa:  declarer is short of communications|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  if he plays @c starting with @cK, E gets 2 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  at the other table, East had opened 1@H, so declarer thought he had 5 @H's|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  if declarer crosses to the table with @dK, club suit will be cut|pg||
nt|ritong: plus two aces= four tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  this should make unless East shifts to a @D to cut the communication|pg||
nt|ritong: bonjour warren|pg||
nt|pelu:  OR: @h back and 2@h + 3 black trick - declarer tryed to make and down 3|pg||
nt|warrens:  bonjour|pg||
nt|pelu:  a red card from E will defeat|pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  sorry, a @H shift also is sufficient, even with only 4 @H's|pg||
nt|game over: (purely DD) you can make it by guessing clubs and diamonds|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I'm ignoring the DD plays|pg||
nt|game over: [purely DD] play a diamond to table, let the club nine run, play a club to the 10 (East must duck), exit with a small diamond|pg||
nt|game over: but this has nothing to do with real life play :)|pg||

pc|d6|mc|7|nt|game over: even after you have started with the @d Jack you can still make it, by playing one round of clubs (!) and exit with a diamond on the spades East will get squeezed and has to part ...|pg||
nt|game over: with a heart, later an endplay will develop against esat in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzeh: next session starting nearly immediatly|pg||
nt|game over: the second round of clubs would be deadly, because East has then control over clubs|pg||
