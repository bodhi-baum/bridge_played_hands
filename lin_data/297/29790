nt|Psyck: sry @d & a maj|pg||
nt|danilo1: we do not know their exact agreements .. but accorsing to their bidding and seen hands, I believe East has shown GF with long, closed or semi.closed @H suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely essential to have agreement about whether Leaping Michaels is forcing or non-forcing|pg||
nt|Psyck: E will surely go to some slam|pg||
nt|Psyck: I would expect 8+ trick hand for leaping michaels|pg||

nt|warrens:  why do I think East would usually bid slam?  Because my typically leaping Michaels hand would be AKJxx, x, KQJxxx, x or the like|pg||
