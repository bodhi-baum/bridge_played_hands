nt|andyv:  J@c to K and 10@d back|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  the pass of 1NT by N was right as the contract could have been set at least 2 tricks, but the execution was lacking|pg||

nt|andyv:  difficult not to balance with a 6 card suit but, S knows pd should have 3 spades and his @h suit is not very good.  At this vul, he could easily be looking at 500 to 800|pg||

nt|andyv:  N will have an interesting choice over a 1@c opener|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  some will bid 1@d, others 3@c and a majority will probably pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|an|3+|nt|andyv:  now 3@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  or even 2NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  as we can see, a double works best here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|vugraphzby: Jolly: did you overbid your hand again partner?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|andyv:  N took a long time before bidding which would have made it difficult for S to take any sort of action if N had passed.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem with 3@c as we can see is that N is playing the whole contract out of his hand.	The dummy is useless to him.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  the ruff of @s takes away one of his tricks so looks like he is heading toward -300 territory|pg||

nt|andyv:  since it looks like 4@h can't make (may not even be bid) this will be an excellent score for EW.|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: The table thought the result was -3, I verified to be sure and now they agree it was -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  good to have you there, Bas :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  easy enough to count the tricks....5 clubs, 1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: Well I am not allowed to influence the players of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: I'm just another kib, but I thought maybe I had made a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N had doubled, S would have bid 3@s, then EW would have a real problem.|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, but good to have someone verify independently|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|andyv:  now it depends on the NS methods.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:	3@c appears to show values|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|andyv:  his 3@h bid is reasonable...he has a stiff and he denied 4 card support.  I like the NS auction here|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|levier17:  the dbl was too agressive here|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 8 of @h is a big enough card for the @d suit.  Now it's a question if S can avoid 3 @d losers|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|levier17:  when agressive both times, then bad things happen|pg||
nt|levier17:  but previosuly this EW pair got a 500 out of nothing dbling so what do we know :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the problem for W|pg||
