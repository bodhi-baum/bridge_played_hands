mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nevereast: so it looks like ew  play	15-17  nt  standard  upgrade from east with a good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|nevereast: or maybe their range is weaker actually not sure|pg||

nt|nevereast: good by  east to attack  @H  immediately	 before he gives away	the diamond  weakness in case the finesse lost|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|nevereast: diamond play  is	bait play  "false-leg" type of thing hoping to bait defense into breaking spades maybe for another overtrick|pg||
nt|nevereast: south   probably has no idea what is going on in this hand but it doesn't make sense|pg||
pc|s2|nt|nevereast: based on  trick one in clubs|pg||
