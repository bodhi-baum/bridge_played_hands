nt|Walddk2: West would have doubled with 4+.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  1NT would doubtless have shown clubs, was it was not available. 1@S is (artificial) bid on a normal 1NT response, as well as other minor-suit types.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  North could bid 2@D with good heart support, so her double suggests a doubleton in hearts and a few points.|pg||
