nt|kareno: Great!  When you have a chance can you put names for the players?  Thanks!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Martin :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: This is our first 'live' auction.  North weak nt, south spades as we see.+|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
mc|9|nt|kareno: Nice play by declarer.	East well may continue hearts giving declarer a chance to draw one more trump and start the diamonds.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|capt_aa:  teh spade slam was reached at other table..	onlyh board two are results still "pending"|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kareno: I believe south responded 1nt here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capt_aa:  Assume bidding was 1H ..Pass...1nt...   etc here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: So looks like losing a club, a heart and a spade with normal play.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: will try to get caught up |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  When hearts prove friendly ..no need for diamond finesse here|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  This game is held in Calgary folks..  home of the famous Rodeo|pg||
nt|kareno: Thurston and Smith play a system they call Swedish Club with 2/1.  Will try to help with auctions but I'm unfamiliar with that system for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: the score on 2 should be -1100 - what do i put?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: the contract was 4hx by w|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzar: for n s|pg||

nt|kareno: A little help from Katie Thorpe:  fantunes style 2M from what i've seen. Presumably 1C=2+ all bal and 1D=5+unbal usually....not 100% though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kareno: So that's board 2 - 1100 instead of 800?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzar: yes|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  It shows Gartaganus losing 800 board 2..but I have a report that it was 1100|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: got it - thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Looks like they are headed for 3nt here.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzar: thanks so much!!|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  If it was 1100..  the score will be 14 and not 12|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D a good contract, especially by south|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kareno: A spade lead is most annoying for declarer since it threatens to separate his minor suit tricks.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  good..corrected|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||

pc|c6|nt|kareno: This contract will prove not to be challenging for north.  Two diamonds, then ace and	a club I think.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|kareno: Barbara, didn't he play the ace of clubs first, not the heart?|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capt_aa:	Always difficult to pass 2NT! in IMP's holding a 5-card suit..weak hand..tooo often makes 3NT!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|kareno: Their 2nt seems very strong.  East has 22 golden!|pg||

nt|kareno: 6@d on board 6?  That won't be a success!|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  only the one slow entry to dummy working..not enough to set up clubs even if the club Jack was smothered|pg||
pc|d8|nt|capt_aa:  bd 5...6D|pg||
nt|kareno: 6 diamonds should make!|pg||
pc|c3|mc|7|nt|capt_aa:	Rock continuing with smal ldiamond to keep the diamond communications open..in cas pard had one less diamond here|pg||

nt|capt_aa:  6D was made bd 5...tightening up the match|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2nt likely Lebensohl, asking opener to bid 3@c so in this case east could bid 3@d.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I imagine 3@h showed aa spade fit.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|capt_aa:  South will exxpect the spde finesse to work here...not to be|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Yes...certainly 2S doid not suggest any heart help here|pg||
nt|kareno: But the spade lead is helpful for declarer - |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  the ten is also useful for declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|kareno: Yes, if east follows with a second spade, they can collect a ruff for an extra undertrick.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Thurston "cashing" as spades lie ominously here|pg||
nt|kareno: East's mind, however, is on not losing cashers to that spade suit in dummy|pg||
mc|8|nt|vugraphzar: only one operator for seniors - sorry|pg||
pg||

nt|capt_aa:  6S on South's mind here..but no play|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  spade lead turned out best for defeence last hand as a spec pointed out|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|capt_aa:  at thks vul...3S openeings can be abysmally weak first seat..  |pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: Still the south hand provides not enough.  Let's see if they can make five.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  but can cause problems for pard when it is pard who has a power house|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: The 'good news' for them is that 5 won't make :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|capt_aa:  there is an assumtion on Rock's part that the spade King will not play a role here|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  North still has hope at this stage...but no chance |pg||
pc|c2|nt|capt_aa:  someone need to come up with a Ogust query to 3S openers here ....bad bad suit...  bsd bad hand|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  assume 5D to be showing zero Key cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kareno: If the minors can be eliminated, there's a possibility for an endplay for 11 tricks.  But in 6 I think he'll play spades too soon for that.|pg||
