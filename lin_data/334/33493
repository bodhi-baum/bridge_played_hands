nt|pef: double dummy, south could have beaten the hand with a low diamond at trick 2.  that looks strange but play it out|pg||
nt|pef: martel actually had to win the first heart in dummy to stop that play|pg||
nt|pef: if he shifted to a low diamond, martel wins.  if he plays a heart to dummy to take a spade finesse then north can get a diamond ruff after pitcing one on a good heart from south|pg||
nt|pef: if he plays a club honor to dummy and overtakes, then with careful defense, north south will end up with 2 hearts, 1 spade, 2 diamonds, and 1 club.  very cute hand, actually|pg||
nt|pef: meanwhile, chip thinking, but all reasonable lines end up successful|pg||
