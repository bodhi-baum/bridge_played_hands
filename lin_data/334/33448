nt|creemore:  The 1996 CNTC Finals were decided in the last quarter...Paul Thurston and his team were down by 40 and came back to win by 4.   They pitched a 44-0 shutout in that quarter.   |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Lineup notes - for McMullin, the captain sits out as Maks/Rock square off against the Gartagani in the other room, leaving Thurston and Smith sending good vibes to their mates from the sidelines|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Gordon intently leaning forward planning the play.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dannymiles:  1996? I'll guess Thurston was playing with Rick Delogu|pg||
pc|h9|nt|creemore:  On the opposing team?   Nick and Judy Gartaganis so I'm sure the Gartagani are hoping for a little Thurstonian Magic|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|mikeh:  Ni is protected to some degree by not having opened 1@c. I don't know if they play 2N as anything special|pg||

nt|creemore:  4@H will make on a spade lead I think, but down otherwise|pg||
nt|creemore:  not that North would lead a spade...|pg||
nt|creemore:  but you never know when trying to recoup 40+ imps|pg||
nt|creemore:  does anyone know how long Gord C. and Ilya have been playing together?|pg||
nt|mikeh:  there are hands on which S can picture a slam, but one would not normally play partner for magic cards|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Agree, he must be thinking of bidding more, hoping for @sAKTxx @hx @dAQxxx @cxx|pg||
nt|mikeh:  AKJxx x Axxxx xx even better|pg||

nt|creemore:  Was it Bob Hamman who said, "Pard, don't play me for the perfect hand because I don't have it."|pg||
mb|p|nt|mikeh:	but Bob was rarely stuck 44 with 14 to play|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Would he have bid 6 with the score 0-0? Only he knows|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Ilya is Pushkinesque. He knows he must have a great segment. He also feels melancholy as he has not been at his best the last three segments he has played.|pg||
