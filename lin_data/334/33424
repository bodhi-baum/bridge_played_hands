nt|kareno: 1@c can be normal with long clubs, balanced, weak notrump or a strong forcing hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: This is the fourth of eight 15-board segments of the CNTC|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Here  we go!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Welcome spectators to segment 4 (of 8) to decide the 2014 Canadian Team Championship. Cozy up to your computer/tablet/phone, pour yourself a glass of your favourite beverage, and enjoy the bridge.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dannymiles:  Youngsters Nystrom & Walsh return to the Open Room where they enjoyed an excellent segment against the Gartagani in segment 3|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Team Gartaganis takes a slight lead into this segment but the match is certainly up for grabs...Remember another 60 boards to play tomorrow|pg||
nt|bbt:  does East persist with the hearts?  The answer is no.....rightly so, I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|creemore:  this contract should play very well for declarer...making 3 or 4|pg||

nt|bbt:  heart shift now, but can't get East back in|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|danmathies:	quiet board to get warmed up|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bbt:  dummy's hearts eventually go off on the diamond winners|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	And indeed Rock and Maksimetz scored up a Heart partial in the other room so we should see 6 IMPs find their way into McMullin's column|pg||
nt|kfung:  good evening all|pg||
nt|kareno: Kismet :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Gordon Deep Blue.|pg||
nt|bbt:  hand was pretty friendly for hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|d3|nt|creemore:	Interesting that Paul with the South hand decided not to bid again after overcalling 1@S, while Tom here doubled to show clubs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kareno: But at the vulnerability, not worth another bid by east.  My system allows me to bid 3@h weak over 1 minor.|pg||
nt|bbt:  South could also have doubled 1H to show both black suits at the expense of not advertising the fifth spade|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzar: Both sides laughing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|creemore:  We're going to need another 60 boards to decide this thing|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like a comfortable spade or notrump game.  If n/s get too ambitious a heart ruff could scuttle a slam|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I admit I'm not entirely familiar with the NS system|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bbt:  slam is not bad|pg||
mb|4S|nt|dannymiles:  I anticipate they will reach a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbt:  but doomed as the cards lie|pg||
nt|kareno: I've seen that auction from them before - 18-19 with four spades.|pg||
nt|creemore:  6NT makes but tough to stay out of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Tom counting winners.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Looking at just the N/S hands, you certainly want to be there. And with South as declarer, West must find the heart lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Unlikely if they bid slam that they will choose notrump.|pg||
nt|kareno: As west, with balanced hands n/s I would be thinking heart ruff |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Spades is a far better strain than notrump....In notrump you need to manufacture a third heart winner. Not a likely occurance|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@s is a good contract especially with all the spade intermediates.	|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|d|nt|dannymiles:  Straight out of Kit Woolsey's book...Aces and kings, no queens and jacks, in the 2 main side suits and all the middle trumps call for playing in the 4-4|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|creemore:  Right, if you could see partner's hand in the auction you would choose spades over notrump|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Now we aren't getting the heart lead|pg||
nt|bbt:  double by Ilya now prevent the winning defense|pg||
nt|kareno: Well the double of 5@c (unnecessary in my opinion) may scuttle the defense.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: worse than unnecessary|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Gordon and Tom in written dialogue.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	East must have been afraid partner would choose the wrong minor suit king to underlead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kareno: That double probably costs them a slam swing.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dannymiles:  But the double could backfire a few ways. Case in point, this hand. West may also bang down the @cA letting declarer score the @cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|kareno: It is a double to hear yourself speak, nothing more.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Ducking the trump ace, as often is the case, is the defense's only chance, hoping declarer worries about 4-1 spades and adopts another line of play. Not today |pg||

mb|p|nt|kfung:	am told that 3d is artificial forcing raise in spades|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kfung:  paul thurston and jeff smith play a modified polish club|pg||
nt|mikeh:  s has a somewhat boring hand, so may be hard pressed to do more than 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: they call it "swedish club'|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kfung:  mike... i don't think that you play enough rubber bridge...s is not boring|pg||
nt|mikeh:  shows how much I know|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mikeh:  he is lucky that partner has the spade J...lucky, that is, unless west leads hearts|pg||
nt|kfung:  I asked jeff what he wanted me to say about him today|pg||

nt|mikeh:  which I think he will....it combines safety and aggression|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: you can talk now kiz...jeff just left the room :)|pg||

nt|bbt:  :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|kareno: Time out would be my play.|pg||

nt|danmathies:	tom walsh showing why hes considered one of our young stars of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Tom thinking|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dannymiles:  4 rounds of hearts and a safe diamond exit will likely see declarer desperately attempt the club finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|bbt:  looks like only eight tricks |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kareno: Tricks are too tangles and n/s can take three more hearts if they are let in.|pg||
nt|kareno: tangled|pg||

pc|dA|pc|c4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Can't even see a distribution that would give him legitimate play...(besides singleton @sK or @sJ which is wildly unlikely)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s8|nt|creemore:  Do you think Gordon's 3NT bid was automatic?	 Seems 2NT would be the right call on high card strength, even with the 5-card @D suit|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	If the opposing hearts were @hKQ and @hAJxxx, that would be a start but with Walsh's club shift attacking communications, it was a moot point|pg||
nt|kareno: I think he was influenced (and a poor idea that is) by the poor result on the previous boards.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|bbt:  maybe he was trying to recoup IMPs from what he knows is going to be a certain adverse swing on board 17|pg||
nt|bbt:  hard to say|pg||
nt|danmathies:	bit pushsy but 5 card suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: Ilya thinking carefully.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dannymiles:  He'd be wise to heed the advice of his captain...I've had Nick G as a non-playing captain before and his central message was being able to focus on this board and put previous results behind you at all costs|pg||
nt|kareno: Danny, that is why I do not keep a private score.  Exactly that.|pg||
nt|danmathies:	short memory great asset|pg||
nt|bbt:  easier said than done.....I remember a match we played in the 2007 CNTCs against Paul Thurston and Rick Delogu.....seemed as if they were doing everything right and eventually frustration set in.|pg||
nt|bbt:  It was a good if somewhat bitter lesson to keep plugging and not deviate from your game no matter what|pg||
nt|kareno: You just need to keep in mind that your responsibility at this moment is the board that is in front of you right now.  Focus, focus, focus.	If you feel like things are getting ...|pg||
nt|kareno: away from you, TAKE A BREAK|pg||
