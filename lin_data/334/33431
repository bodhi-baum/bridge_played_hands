mb|3D|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lady007:  interesting hand to start with|pg||
nt|lady007:  east had a natural 4@c overcall available where many pairs nowadays play 4@c as some kind of 2 suiter (usually clubs+ a major)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  as it is, it seems that 3N is the only game that has some chance of making, but even that contract is in trouble in a diamond lead to the king if south ducks the king of clubs|pg||

nt|lady007:  cullin was worried about the AQxxxx hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|lady007:  thinking that if partner has a singleton hearts declarer can take a heart finesse and thereby set up the hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  but now declarer can discard his diamond loser on the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  and suddenly hasnt got a spade loser anymore either|pg||
nt|lady007:  so it will probably make now|pg||
nt|lady007:  Cullin hoping that declarer had Qxx x Kx AQJxxxx|pg||

nt|lady007:  west will think it is the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|lady007:  as you normally try to avoid splintering with stiff ace |pg||

mb|3H|nt|lady007:  spec ask if west could have bid 4@h. that would just be a cuebid and giving partner opportunity to take control with 4N. better to bid blackwood yourself with such an extreme hand|pg||
nt|lady007:  because partner will have no idea about your hand and you cannot except him to judge the hand well here|pg||
nt|lady007:  1@h transfer, showing 4+ spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  NS dont play support doubles, so 2@s is 3+ support|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lady007:  but now its a bit difficult for north as he doesnt know if they have a fit or not (if 43 fit, south will be less likely to have heart stopper because its not mandatory to support on 3)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  east not too happy either|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lady007:  but at least he has a maximum|pg||
nt|lady007:  south made a good lead, trying to prevent club ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer has some communication issues, lack of entries to his hand to play diamonds|pg||
nt|lady007:  and norths 98 of clubs might give him 2 entries to play more spades to prevent club ruffs is thats declarers plan|pg||
nt|lady007:  he can of course duck the first spade trick to his hand, but that might well be the last time he gets there|pg||
nt|lady007:  so you often want to keep options open and take the first trick in the hand with the many entries|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer has 5 tricks to start with|pg||
nt|lady007:  and options in diamonds and ruffs to get more|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer is taking so long in trick one because he has to decide what his plan is for the whole hand|pg||
nt|lady007:  that will also tell him wether to take the spade in dummy or in his hand|pg||
nt|lady007:  you shouldnt automatically say "thanks partner, play small" and then find out it would have been better to win in dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lady007:  north played the @s2 on the first trick, suit preference for clubs|pg||
nt|lady007:  so south knew it was safe to underlead ace of clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer could have won this trick in dummy and play a club to the queen|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lady007:  because south has ace of clubs and AKQ of hearts there is no way to let north in another time to prevent the club ruff |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lady007:  (and KQ of diamonds in case south would have played a small diamond) |pg||
nt|lady007:  then he could have waited for his KT of spades to score 2 tricks later (never play spades yourself and wait for opps to give you a ruff or to play another spade)|pg||
nt|lady007:  but now that he won the spade in hand this doesnt work anymore|pg||
nt|lady007:  because he has to ruff with the queen of spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lady007:  but instead he hopes to ruff a heart in his hand as well|pg||
nt|lady007:  that way it doesnt matter if he has to ruff a club with the ace|pg||
nt|lady007:  instead south decides on a gamble by playing a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007:  bertheau is a good poker player and he sometimes likes to play poker at the bridge table|pg||
nt|lady007:  "all in" he says now|pg||
nt|lady007:  will east think that bertheau passed quite fast the first time with 19 HCP?|pg||

nt|lady007:  not sure it even helped then|pg||
nt|lady007:  them|pg||
nt|lady007:  because north has to ruff the next diamond to play another trump! |pg||
nt|lady007:  maybe he can also discard a heart|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lady007:  then south has to play a club back instead of a heart, otherwise declarer will still win a trick on the 7 of spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  because it will go heart ruff - overrruff, club ruff, heart and now declarer has the 7 of spades behind the 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: decl showed his hand to peter. Peter instantly responding "then i play this"|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: decl realized that everything was not done and dusted|pg||
nt|lady007:  is north sure who has the jack of clubs? can it be wrong to ruff here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcr: depends on what the 5@c was i guess|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d8|pg||
mc|6|nt|lady007:  so the small diamond backfired even if declarer didnt put in the jack|pg||

nt|vugraphzcr: peter making the same remark at the table|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lady007:  1N it is. they are protected abit by there system to bid on weak hands because north will rebid 2@c on any bid hand, on which south can show that he had a very weak hand with 2-3 spades|pg||

nt|lady007:  but they probably would have bidden game as well if south had passed or bid 2@s|pg||
nt|lady007:  not sure if west would double or bid 3@h if south would have bid 2@s. a new popular treatment is that in that position 2N shows 5+H and 4+m because those hands are very awkward to bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|lady007:  very light opening by east|pg||
nt|lady007:  but in 3rd position you dont want to give the opponents a "free ride"|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@h by west now?|pg||
nt|lady007:  or has he seem his partners bidding before?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lady007:  http://runningscores.se/landskamp/resultat.html for results|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|lady007:  a spec suggested to psych 1@s. that might of course work well but with a singleton spades its likely that the opponents will have enough spades to bid them anyway and then it might have been better to preempt higher the first time|pg||
nt|lady007:  west took the low road here, a little unexpected to me|pg||
nt|lady007:  of course north south would always have bid (at least?) game here|pg||
nt|lady007:  now south has a great hand|pg||
nt|lady007:  but north likely to have singleton hearts, so king of hearts not that heart|pg||
nt|lady007:  not that great|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  will he just bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|lady007:  i often play that a jump in a new suit after partners cuebid shows 5+ and a hand that was too strong to overcall the first time|pg||
nt|lady007:  with only 4crd you make another cuebid (or take out double if thats the case)|pg||

nt|lady007:  of course east would rather have had a better heart suit for his opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  but might still be the right lead against 3N, even if it seems to cost a heart trick when delcarer has AQx|pg||

nt|vugraphzcr: down on @d lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  only real chance needed and will win ..heja Cullin |pg||
nt|lady007:  south decided to take a gamble in slam|pg||
nt|lady007:  might have expected a little better cards from his partner|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lady007:  north was a little weak for 3@h, but probbaly decided he wanted to play game anyway and can just as well show his shape (or should 3@h with passed hand not be game forcing? thats too difficult for me)|pg||
nt|lady007:  wow, diamond lead|pg||
nt|runnerup:  killing lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lady007:  that will mean a quick end to the contract|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  south would probably not have bid 3N over a 1N opening|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lady007:  but he expect most finesses to work now, and partner will have a better idea about where all the honors are placed which will make it easier to play the hand|pg||
nt|lady007:  therefore most people are more agressive in bidding game opposite a 1N overcall than over a 1N opening|pg||
nt|lady007:  we can see that west has the singleton queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|lady007:  so that declarer cannot really go down |pg||
nt|lady007:  but Cullin doesnt know that|pg||
nt|lady007:  he is thinking if he should use up his one sure entry to take the diamond finesse (its also bad to take the ace of hearts because it might cost you a 3rd round heart stopper)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lady007:  might play ace of diamonds? that will make life easier for him directly|pg||
nt|lady007:  but he might not want to give away too much of his hand |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lady007:  east will regret playing the 7 now|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer probably more hoping for east having lead from JTx|pg||
nt|lady007:  in that case west is kind of endplayed here|pg||
nt|lady007:  JTxx sorry|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|lady007:  west doesnt feel endplayed now of course with his stiff queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|runnerup:  leading partners opening suit or @s should have cursed some problems |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lady007:  but thats a very welcome card for Cullin|pg||
nt|lady007:  he still has some communication problems|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lady007:  but west will first have to find some discards (and dummy as well)|pg||

nt|lady007:  he had to retain the small club to be able to play a club to the king, thereby endplaying west|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lady007:  (and later endplaying him again to lead away from jack of clubs)|pg||
