nt|dannymiles:	Interesting auction thusfar. EW are cold for 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbt:  might be a tough chore now, though|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|dannymiles:  Not sure what Dbl shows by South. If he remained quiet, he'd get to defend 2@d. |pg||
nt|bbt:  South will go back to clubs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kareno: I'd be surprised if Nick and Judy can untangle this auction and find 3nt.|pg||
nt|bbt:  that might get doubled as well|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I think Judy had to take a more aggressive stance on her 2nd turn to reach 3NT. |pg||
nt|kareno: Judy has, though, shown a powerhouse hand.  |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  It will certainly be Judy to find the 3nt csll if it is bid|pg||
nt|bbt:  defense can take AK of both minor suits, ace of hearts and a ruff|pg||

nt|capt_aa:  difficult to judge what might be the results at other table|pg||

nt|shuster:  N/S have a -2 save|pg||
mb|4H|nt|shuster:  I'd bid 2@S.  I believe that the goal against strong clubs is to get to 2M and then get out.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  I could also believe pass could be the winner, hoping to not tip them that spades are a danger in NT|pg||

mb|1N|nt|kareno: I'm sure that's it - board not complete|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Yes that's what I meant. Which should go for 800 if NS collect their tricks|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kareno: Which should be easy.	|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Gartaganis likely to pick up 11 IMPs on 18|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bbt:  and that would be 11 IMPs back to Gartaganis|pg||
mb|2S|nt|shuster:  appearts to be a forcing stayman auction.  5-5 hands can be a bit awkward in those methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  11-13 NT here followed by game forcing stayman|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kareno: 2@d gfs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  West conveniently rebid below 3@D, allowing East to bid out|pg||
mb|3N|nt|bbt:  and their best start to a quarter in a fair while|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  oy vey|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Oops|pg||
pc|cT|nt|capt_aa:  4th best again?|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Surely 3@d was a better call by E? I'm not sure how they play continuations over GF Stayman, whether Nick should raise 2@s to 3|pg||
nt|kareno: They should be able to find their way to a 5-3 spade fit.  I can respond 3@h to two way stayman with five hearts AND three spades, for instance.|pg||
nt|shuster:  East chose not to bid out, and West chose not to raise 2@S.  Together those decisions are unfortunate for the Gartaganis squad.|pg||
nt|shuster:  If they were trying to generate a swing, I predict they will be successful in that endeavor|pg||

nt|dannymiles:	I'm sure Samantha wishes she'd led a low club...When the @c9 falls from declarer at trick 1, South would cash the other high honour|pg||
nt|shuster:  I assume this diamonds and a higher or diamonds and spades.. anyone know?|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@d some sort of Suction?|pg||

nt|bbt:  will south double?|pg||
nt|bbt:  Hopefully North doesn't bid 4D|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  but doesn't necessarily have clubs..  today he does|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think maybe they'll beat it two though|pg||
nt|bbt:  that would be bad|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 2nt Lebensohl, 3@s expecting more spades in east.|pg||
nt|shuster:  diamond, diamond ruff, then threerounds of clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: Only with mirrors.  |pg||
nt|shuster:  if declarer ruffs up the ace, then the spade jack promotes|pg||
nt|shuster:  if he doesn't, then they get another diamond ruff|pg||
nt|bbt:  North on lead|pg||
nt|bbt:  probably a club or the K of hearts|pg||
nt|shuster:  a club lead and a diamond shift transposes, but the HK lead is normal|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  I think Sam' will start club here|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd guess a relatively safe club.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|shuster:  as is so often the case with doubled partscores, the opening lead can swing a bunch of tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: Ah, that was always possible too|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  best we give up on predictions!|pg||
nt|shuster:  declarer has a lot of losers.  A trump may beat it two also|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Guesses the trump suit for declarer but South's great club spots mean the trick could easily come back|pg||
nt|shuster:  might even beat it three on some lines|pg||
nt|kareno: Usually when trumps are led on this sort of hand, anything lost comes back and often with extras.|pg||
nt|danmathies:	knew she would lead a spade,heart,diamond or club|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dannymiles:  As a general rule, when declarer is in a 4-3 fit, the defenders want to play trumps if they are breaking 3-3, and want to shorten declarer's trumps if they are breaking 4-2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|capt_aa:  a trump lead looks to be pretty good |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kareno: Note it is easier to lead from the trump K than the J so declarer should probably consider the play of the queen|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|shuster:  I like having a way to get out in 3m after stayman if it fails to find a fit|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  difficult to nail the weak nt..as normally they have an 8-card fit they find at 2-level..	they managed down 2...but 3nt might be coming in other table|pg||

mb|3H|nt|danmathies:  tom and sam keeping team in match|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  McMullin's M.O. this match has been starting strong and struggling during the last few hands...with them struggling at the start, perhaps they score some pickups at the finish?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Can't recall a CNTC final this high scoring as we approach 500 total IMPs. We are still in segment 6 of 8, and recall they shaved 1 board/segment this year (used to be 128, now 120 total)|pg||
