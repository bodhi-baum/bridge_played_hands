mb|p|nt|kareno: Two mixed pairs|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|bbt:  They did play 4S at the other table but even that wnt down|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Nick and Judy Gartaganis (hereafter referred to as the "Gartagani") are a very successful husband/wife team from Calgary and have won this event numerous times including last year|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzar: Tom deep in thought.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Tom Walsh is the youngest player remaining, from Saskatchewan, in his first CNTC final. Samantha Nystrom is a grizzled veteran compared to Tom (but she's young compared to the rest of us)....she's been on the women's team but I don't |pg||
nt|bobholl: isn't this passable ?|pg||
nt|bbt:  3S by North was "last train" to 3NT, probably|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	believe she's won the CNTC (please correct me if I'm wrong)|pg||
nt|bbt:  not a full stopper|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Confirmed, Samantha has never won the CNTC|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dannymiles:  I confess I do not understand the meaning of 3@H. |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|bbt:  cuebid, I guess|pg||
nt|bbt:  always intending to show the major-suit Aces|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm really happy to see good, strong women players in this event at this level.  When I won it (in prehistoric days) I was the first woman to do so.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Blackwood for clubs would have been my cup of tea. 1 = bid 6. 2 = bid 7|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Now South may be in a quandry if North produces a slow 6@c, which is likely|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, spades are a diversion when your six-card suit has been raised.|pg||
mb|7C|nt|bbt:  I would have expected a keycard check from responder|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: they got there, but scarey way|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Perhaps they did employ keycard, without us knowing :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|bbt:  I suspect that was the case|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: JUdy and Tom in written dialogue.|pg||
nt|bbt:  :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, seems like three extra rounds of bidding were employed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Do they award extra IMPs for style points?|pg||

nt|dannymiles:	North/South would be enjoying this at a nickel a point|pg||
nt|bbt:  looks to be 4S on this hand by NS|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bbt:  two clubs and a heart to lose for sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bbt:  have to guess both spades and diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  This year the Canadian Bridge Federation moved the Women's championship to August instead of concurrent with the CNTC....so some of the women are playing in both events - CNTC in May, CWTC in August|pg||
nt|bbt:  not betting on that happening|pg||
nt|kareno: Checkback I'd say|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bbt:  think they have at least eight teams for the Women's championships the last I saw|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: That's much fairer.  When I played the CNTC I had to give up the women's event.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Judy will solve one of the problems for declarer after she cashes the @cAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: passed 3@s?|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerable at IMPs?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bbt:  yes, a lot of top-level players use 3C as Wolff signoff, to sign off in a major suit, so 3D becomes the checkback|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Passing 3@s is quite the position|pg||
nt|kareno: I bid that way too.	We used to call it Gladiator.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|bbt:  but a fortuitous one, it will turn out|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	North's @cQ much better positioned in any of the other 3 suits|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: This is in error. 4S made 4. My apologies to all.|pg||

nt|kareno: North should lead the spade jack, not the queen for some possible extra information.|pg||
nt|bbt:  could be a loser in every suit|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Making 4@s here will also be a good result....will Walsh follow through with his agressive bidding by taking the right view in trumps?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	technically he should lead the @sJ from hand and try to get a read on how quickly East covers|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||

nt|kareno: The hint for the specs is to lead high when you want a cover and low when you don't.  Here north has struck gold at once!!|pg||

nt|kareno: Declarer was dancing on air - a diamond return after that finesse would have done him in.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|dannymiles:  3@c looks to be puppet stayment, checking on 4 and 5 card majors|pg||

nt|vugraphzar: SCreen down. Tom has advised Judy of some missed detail.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbt:	Nick and Judy play 11-13 notrumps in 1st and 2nd chair, so East was never doing anything but pass|pg||
