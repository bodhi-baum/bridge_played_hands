nt|gsper:  In view of the @H distribution, NS may get too high|pg||

nt|gsper:  since their blatant lack of @C control damps slam interest|pg||
nt|andyv:  since EW play precision, E will have to decide whether to open 2@c or pass|pg||

nt|andyv:  the 2@d bid is a handy gadget that allows the 2@c overcall to have disparity in the length of the 2 suits.|pg||
