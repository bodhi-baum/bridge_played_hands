mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but presumably S can show a dead minimum at some point|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: They must avoid the 5-level.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Both these teams are fighting to avoid relegation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although they probably will survive when South is declarer.|pg||
mb|5N|nt|Walddk2: Scary.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6 has no play on this layout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sverjohn: Think both should have put on the brakes earlier. 4@c should show singleton |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's important to get your minimum in right away, 3@C for example.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's hopeless when you can't limit your hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: Should south sign off when Jensen did not bid 4@d?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: some pairs play that, on this kind of sequence, the 4@c cue is mandatory, minimum or not - but for sure 5@C doesn't sound like a minimum....  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe, but North could have @DQ.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: In my opinion yes. He has a clear minimum. North has to cuebid his hearts despite the duplication of values in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem was it appears that no-one knew how strong they were between them.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and S has a decent 5530 shape, despite only an 11-hcp hand, so whether S is minimum or not is debatable  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but for sure the final contract is not very good. Needs a very favourable diamond position (which it is not going to get)	|pg||
