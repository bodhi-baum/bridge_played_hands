mb|2S!|an|Michaels|nt|eggy:  what does "semi-foring" mean - semantically nothig surely?|pg||
nt|psyCK:  it is non forcing NT|pg||
nt|psyCK:  opener bids with more than min values or non balanced hands|pg||
nt|psyCK:  and passes with min balanced hands|pg||
nt|sommer: In my opinion any 1NT in 2/1 is semiforcing:)|pg||
nt|sommer: ..if used correctly|pg||
nt|psyCK:  a matter of terminology; somr would consider that there are only two types of bids in Bridge, Forcing & Non-Forcing|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|No agreement|nt|sommer: ..not in my defenition;-)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|4D|nt|eggy:  half (semi) forcing is ,eaningless however|pg||
nt|psyCK:  W passes to show no preferance, N could possibly bid 3@s once South doubled|pg||
nt|eggy:  but I am prepared to admit that all experienced players know what is meant by it :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psyCK:  As the voice commentators point, N could have bid 3@s 1st time around instead of giving East a chance to get another bid in|pg||
