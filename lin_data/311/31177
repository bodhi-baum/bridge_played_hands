nt|petergill: It's become fashionable among experts that in response to 1@C, you bypass 5 or 6 card @d suit to respond 1@H or 1@S - the Hackett twins extend the same principle to the opening ...|pg||

nt|petergill: slow and careful bidding towards 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|ady: Price and Simpson   1@C  1@D    1NT	   3NT	 much simpler|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C was 5+@C GF or 5+ @D GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 5+ @D|pg||
nt|petergill: They can do this because they play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 2@C was 5+ @D, 1NT would be 5+ clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Sorry 5@C or 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: No I was right the first time|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: My eyesight or their small font size :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm finding it hard to interpret what their System Card means|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT played by south  better   just possible to go wrong on a heart lead from east if north declarers|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 1N=5+@C GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 2@C=5+@D GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: 2@D=6+Major 4-8pts|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, if 3NT by North on low heart lead, North should insert @H10 at Trick 1, to prevent a possible guess later if Trick 1 goes low, low, 9, K|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries to dummy for @D towards !KQ are awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: and @H4 could easily be from 5 card @H suit|pg||
nt|petergill: This is quite a tricky hand to play from the South seat|pg||
nt|petergill: I have no idea what the best line of play is|pg||
nt|petergill: You cannot play @HK from dummy at Trick 1, for West could easily have AJxxx in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: @CQ, @C to ace, then do you play @CK or don't you?|pg||
nt|jbgood:  the best line is more difficult now - ! k to the first trick would have made the play much quicker|pg||
nt|jbgood:  @h|pg||

nt|petergill: Attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Smith (Hi = encourage), so South can tell North that South does not have @CK|pg||
nt|petergill: Low pip by South at Trick 2 will deny @CK|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: @H3 being the low pip|pg||
nt|petergill: North now knows West has @CK but cannot be sure about @C10|pg||
nt|jbgood:  right Peter - N has to play a @d now!|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps N should have ducked @H to K, to prevent the problem of what to play now?|pg||
nt|ady: not easy for north   |pg||
nt|petergill: North went in with @HA in case @D were running|pg||
nt|ady: problem with ducking heart is if a spade to thr queen is played    what then?|pg||
nt|jbgood:  think he played the king to get a signal to the lead - low heart discouraging in clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: @H can be disaster if South had @HJ743 or @HQ743 - this West is quite capable of the tricky @H play on those layouts|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jbgood:  he found it|pg||
nt|petergill: North doing well|pg||
nt|jbgood:  yes . very nice|pg||
nt|bobholl: and necesseray :) |pg||
nt|petergill: North's logic = if @Ds are running, 3NT is surely cold, so playing @D9 is best|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=600  Smith Echo|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: When West plays low from dummy, South has to decide whether to play @DA (safe as it turns out, with @H not running) or low @D|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: I think @DA for club back is best, otherwise South might never ever get on lead|pg||

nt|petergill: This time Forrester opened 2@D and Jason H passed his poor suit - no middle ground of 1@H by them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: IMHBAICO, the spade lead by W was questionable. admittedly E would be unlikely to have a holding so strong it could double 1S , but it is still a straw in the wind, and meanwhile ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this spade holding is always dangerous to lead from, and there is a reasonABLE ALTERNATIVE|pg||
nt|jbgood:  people question the raise to 3 NT by N - to me it is quite normal|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence still has the tempo to send this down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to me 3N is clear. just bid your & %$ games and go down when you	$ &*(  have to|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, normal. If South has a fitting @D honour, 3NT would have good chances|pg||
nt|jbgood:  beautiful lingo, Marshall:)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: it has chancces even so|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 2N, yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on a good day even 1N will go down :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Reason for @D to king is: if it wins, he plans to play club though East, playing East for @CAx and West for diamonds including @DA|pg||
nt|petergill: @HJ in dummy makes @H switch dangerous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes he was reluctant to assume the defense would continue to be tempo-friendly|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Jason asking questions|pg||
nt|petergill: but @S2 lead means East knows spades aee 4-4-3-2|pg||
nt|jbgood:  not so easy to play a @h with the jack in dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right that is what i said at the start. however a LOT depends on the EW leading and signaling methods  --  if EW play 4th best leads, and/or smith echo, S can expect a heart switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: EW play standard smith|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in contrast, againnst a pair who just lead "small encouraging" one could hope for a spade continuation from E|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: I agree with Marshall that @H10 would be a more than reasonable lead at Trick 1|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the smith echo factor is less pertinent because W will often have a holding where his card on the first round of diamonds is forced|pg||
nt|petergill: EW play Smith, and natural signals. I don't know why @H9 was played|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew system card a few years ago http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems%5C2010europeanchampionships-ostend%5Copen%5Cengland/hackett-hackett.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: It was the 10 but I missclicked and decided it didn't matter :)|pg||
nt|jbgood:  some show distribution (when appropriate) to declarer's first played suit and NOT Smith |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|petergill: 3Nt will go minus 100 or 150, whatever he does|pg||
nt|petergill: so he's now wondering whether to unblock the nine|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|petergill: West played @H10, has 96 remaining|pg||
nt|petergill: West knows that if he doesn't unblock, 3NT must fail|pg||

pc|d7|nt|vugraphzex: Time becoming an issue now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if andrew leads a D|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in both rooms.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think Justin's 2@D bid over Rdbl showed 4 or 5 @D's - with only 3 @Ds he would have passed the Rdbl (unless they play "Pass of Rdbl" as for penalty)|pg||
nt|ady: did not bother with the try|pg||
nt|petergill: Hamman's Rule - when in doubt, try 3NT. |pg||
nt|ady: what lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: @S8 perhaps? Or @S10? or a low heart?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: hen 4 rounds of diamonds	 tricky for Robson|pg||
nt|petergill: Andy Robson doesn't like to lead from that spade holding, but he might have to switch to a spade to beat 3NT |pg||
nt|ady: then|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood:  low heart is quite natural|pg||
nt|petergill: He can release two hearts if @Ds are played|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: Robson cannot be sure that declarer doesn't have AQ doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|jbgood:  hearts was not the winning line|pg||
nt|petergill: South might take about 4 or 5 minutes to play the next card|pg||
nt|ady: thats quite good for Andy in a difficult situation|pg||
nt|petergill: If you can ses all 52 cards, you can see that only a heart now loses |pg||
nt|jbgood:  not easy to find the winning def - as Roland said on voice S has to reurn a diamond to beat|pg||
nt|petergill: see|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: and a @C peter|pg||
nt|petergill: I see - @S9 can be set up if any spade is played|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ loses if partner has Qxx in @D|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps more like 6 or 7 minutes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Andy Robson is a truly great player - he likes to take his time at the vital moments, when a game swing is at stake|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: When East plays @SJ, fall of @S8 makes 3NT easy to make|pg||

nt|petergill: so that @S7 in dummy perhaps made the best defence to exit with @DJ, which also might lose if declarer has Q9xx in @D|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 19 - perhaps N should play hi-lo in @H with @SQJ or @SA, or lo-hi in @H otherwise, but virtually no pair in the whole world plays signals like that|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood:  he will surely get a club lead now?|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF checkback|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT denies 3 spades, I think also denies 5 hearts (but I'm not sure)|pg||
nt|jbgood:  not having bid his club suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Jason and Justin, like their father Paul, like the preemptive and "difficult to defend against " nature of opening lots of 4 card majors|pg||
nt|jbgood:  kibs suggests a diamond, but some tende to lead from what they have ...|pg||
nt|ady: good thing South not 1st in hand   to open a weak 2    around 1100 if east west get at it|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|nt|jbgood:	to me that lead was surprising|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice lead in my opinion - the main chance to beat 3NT is if partner has something like @HKQ109xx and an entry  |pg||
nt|jbgood:  spades come in|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: Robson asking if 1@H could have longer minor, possibly|pg||
