nt|uni_cicam: sometimes its a good idea to stay low and collect a + score|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 5@D can be made with not precise defence|pg||
nt|gsper:  I don't think I would have found either of the winning leads|pg||
nt|gsper:  Definitely not @H with singleton trump|pg||
nt|gsper:  Just possibly @CA|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  lack of points, poor suits, and the vulnerability will keep EW quiet|pg||
