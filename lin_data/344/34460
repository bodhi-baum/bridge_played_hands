mb|p|nt|ntmon: good work has been done already when N declares NT contract|pg||

nt|uni_cicam: you can accept with a 3+fit and bid 3Nt with doubleton @S|pg||
nt|ntmon: East merely accepted the transfer, but most pairs have rules to show support|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: that gives you a chance to start cuebidding and also to distinguish the shortness cuebid from honor cuebid|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam: the other way is to accept with doubleton so if partner is weak, he can pass 3M|pg||
