mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|shengabus:	A wise pass by south.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|shengabus:  Usually most standard players don't delve into responses to strong jump shifts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shengabus:  3NT; I like that actually.|pg||
mb|p|nt|shengabus:  Somewhat final.|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  if 2@S are GF, you might still try for a @H contract by bidding 2NT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|shengabus:  It's also the cheapest call, so that partner can express @h support, or 'self' @c support|pg||
nt|vugraphzap: 2@s are GF :)|pg||
nt|shengabus:  4@h is somewhat better (might make), better transportation|pg||
nt|shengabus:  i can't think of much better than hoping for @hAK onside|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  fast arrival is also the way, but only if you know what is the best contract|pg||
nt|shengabus:  This feels like the type of contract I've been declaring recently. Headache|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  declarer should try to establish @H while defenders have to escape with @S|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shengabus:  Rising Ace here is quite nice, protects partner's @h holding|pg||
nt|shengabus:  From N perspective, partner might have 4 hearts|pg||
nt|shengabus:  South led the @d8|pg||
nt|shengabus:  (second best) = discouraging|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  yes, but 8@D should show a negative lead so North should know South has only one higher card|pg||
nt|shengabus:  so maybe the @d return here is unwise|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Usually if it's the 8, partner often has the 9. Since with 4-to-the-10-8, it might be treated as an honor sequence|pg||
nt|shengabus:  (partner might have led low)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|uni_cicam:  might be from KJ98, but East jumped to 3NT so he should have a good @D stopper|pg||

nt|vugraphzap: S has diamond in her hand, but still thinking|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Thinking can lead to damage. A good exit here is the @s K|pg||
