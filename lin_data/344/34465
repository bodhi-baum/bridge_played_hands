mb|p|nt|vugraphzar: hello|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: pretty common misunderstanding here, it seems|pg||
nt|athene: probably east thinks "cue = stayman" after 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|athene: and West just thinks "system on" |pg||

pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: 3nt looking quite short|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|athene: of course south put west with more of the missing spades|pg||

nt|athene: OK the girls are sitting S and E, sorry, right?|pg||
nt|athene: S and W|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: well.... i must say they seem very yong and fairly unexperienced...|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: no, athene sory.... S and W|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|athene: the whole issue of "system on or not?" produces a fine regular crop of misunderstandings|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you play Bergen Raises, are they on over double? are they on as a passed hand? etc|pg||
nt|Authau: I think Girls can sit anywhere, but they have to keep their same seat all along the segment, right ?|pg||
nt|athene: i have no idea but that seems quite probable :)|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: and the interest here is the diamond suit|pg||
nt|athene: suppose you run the queen and it goes small - small - small|pg||
nt|athene: do you play west for Kx (small to ace next) or east for 10x (lead the jack next)?|pg||
nt|Authau: or some NT by N|pg||
nt|athene: usually people lead the jack on the second round for two reasons:|pg||
nt|athene: a) west is more likely to cover from Kx than Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: b) it's more fun to pin things than drop things|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|an|cue|mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Authau: so if you lead Q@d-covered-, do you next finesse 10@d or play W for K10 ?|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: with Kx it is normal for west to cover because east might have 109x|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if it goes queen - king - ace, it is normal to finesse next|pg||
nt|athene: here, for example, declarer has the spots to pick up 10642 with east|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything else|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: also K6/K4/K2 is 3 times as likely as K10 |pg||
nt|Authau: anyway, the Danish Pair took the best spot (except anyone plays 7)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: there are some opportunities for bluff and double-bluff if both sides know the exact layout|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|athene: if declarer tried the ten, north could play ace and small, and declarer might well not put in the 8|pg||
nt|athene: now south gets the ruff and the fourth spade is not set up either|pg||
nt|athene: sorry declarer might well not put in the 7, i mean|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|an|allerter by erika|nt|Authau: in that 4@c forcing for you ? or last train ?|pg||
nt|athene: well west has relayed so many times i can't believe it is not all GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: starting to lead a little high, since they are giving  2hearts and 1spades either way|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|athene: 2@D might be GF or just F1|pg||
nt|athene: but even if it's only forcing one round, surely 2@S is GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|athene: probably quite a few EW pairs will play 3NT down one|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: so this is likely to be middling|pg||

mc|11|nt|Authau: Sophia likes special leads...or is she too stressed ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: the time has allready passed|pg||
nt|athene: well, if you remember earlier she led @S6 from @S96 doubleton against 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: so if they lead low from a doubleton, that sort of explains the @HJ :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  EW are an inexperienced pair from Wales|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|paulg:  They've been struggling to find any junior pairs so good to see one here|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Authau: E missed Q@s, so happy not to be in slam|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with these hands is how to get the trumps drawn whilst retaining control of spades|pg||
