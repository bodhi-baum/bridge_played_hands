nt|uni_cicam: 3% for a medal is quite a lot, 102 boards will be played in total|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: so a top-zero is 1% in the final scores, right?|pg||

nt|timverbeek:	EHAA is the system of Milan and Michal when they were young|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: I found lately a good option to play 2@D strong and 2@C as both majors|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: 1@C 12-14 or 18-20 balanced with transfers|pg||
nt|timverbeek:	well if you play majors either put it in 2@C or 2@H|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: that gives you the option to open very strong hands with 1 level openings|pg||
