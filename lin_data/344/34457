nt|paulg:  4@d is pick a major|pg||

nt|Authau: So, seems +1|pg||
mc|11|nt|paulg:  that will probably be an 80% score for the overtrick|pg||
nt|paulg:  A bit like playing on BBO, just bidding and making a normal game is worth 60%|pg||
nt|Authau: lol|pg||
nt|paulg:  As the field is very diverse in experience|pg||
nt|bebechira: East http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=28557|pg||
nt|bebechira: Paul Gipson http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=27295|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Authau: We have 5 segments of 10 boards today ? Am I right ?|pg||
nt|paulg:  However it looks like NS are playing Gazzilli, perhaps one of the more experienced pairs|pg||
nt|paulg:  Yes, they played 52 yesterday and 50 today for two boards against every pair|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  So Gazzilli is a 2@c rebid that is either natural or any hand with 16+ HCP|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@s will show less than 8 points with a six-card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Authau: humm|pg||
nt|paulg:  so South will bid game unless she can play at a lower level doubled|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|paulg:  I do a fair amount of work with the Scottish juniors and there is a tendency for inexperienced players to pass when they don't know what to bid|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||

nt|Authau: 1@s ?|pg||

nt|paulg:  perhaps 2@c, forcing with clubs, 1@s showing diamonds or a balanced hand, or 3NT :)|pg||
mb|1S!|an|=> 1nt|nt|Authau: :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  but it does depend on how weak your 1@c opener can be|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Authau: 12hcp facing an opening bid is not an "invit" in Junior Paul:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  in the recent European Championships, 25% of the open pairs played this system .. short 1@c with transfer responses|pg||
nt|vugraphzar: that's right :-D|pg||
