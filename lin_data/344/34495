mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|andreakis:  with 5minor and 4spades you can opt for 1 in a minor|pg||
nt|pelu:  and if NS play 12-14 NT? :)|pg||
nt|andreakis:  but with 5minor and 4hearts you are endplayed over 1@S from partner|pg||

nt|lokaty: so fast 10 tricks here right now.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu:	what do u lead from W?= 2NT looks like just 2-suited - but then @c+@d or @D+@H and both cases @d-lead|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|ryskiel_: double shoul usually show other mayor, 2 NT should be on two lowest IMO|pg||

mc|10|nt|uni_cicam: it also depends on your opening style|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: East has a 2-suiter opening in most systems|pg||
nt|andreakis:  Italian players rarely open 2-suiters|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: after passed hand 2NT should be both minors and double M+m|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: or a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|andreakis:  we could argue that both treatments could be good, but most important is to talk with your partner about that|pg||
nt|uni_cicam: all depends on agreements - so far both plays the same way, I do not care :)|pg||
