mb|3D|an|alerted|nt|athene: and will then probably choose 6@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|alerted|nt|athene: to choose between 6@C and 6@H you would need to know a) whether west has the @HJ and b) which defender has the @SK :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|alerted|nt|athene: you would rather put the defender with the @SK on lead so that a spade lead does not set them up a trick |pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: someone points out that if you play in clubs, a heart lead might cut you from dummy|pg||
mb|4C|an|alerted|nt|athene: but then you would still be ok most of the time, using the trump to get back to the west hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|alerted|nt|jbgood:  double = trouble?|pg||
nt|athene: for example win the @HA then run the @CJ - if it wins, run the @C10; if both of those hold, run the hearts :)|pg||
