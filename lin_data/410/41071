nt|mug: easy major-suit game here, but no slam|pg||
nt|mug: South hasn't done anything stupid, just everything landed butter side down|pg||
nt|odysseus69: system down again?|pg||
nt|mug: anyway, Bulgaria can afford a heavy defeat, England could not|pg||
nt|mug: only 3 VP off qualifying position now, with plenty of duffer teams to come|pg||

nt|the_boss: 3@H  ask for stopper with long suit|pg||
nt|the_boss: me too|pg||
nt|mug: North was having a bit of a joke, so he removed without waiting for partner|pg||

nt|mug: and it's a possible slam|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mug: 6@C or 6NT, makable on club finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and it rolls home|pg||
nt|mug: with spade finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|mug: 5@C 3@S 2@D 2@H|pg||
nt|mug: could be a way to go off, cashing two top clubs and going about the other suits, though|pg||
nt|mug: or you could hook South for @CQ, I suppose, but that's not the percentage play in the suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mug: no, I don't know anything about the EBL press conference|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|aardv:  you might start with a spade finesse.  which might hold.|pg||
nt|mug: 3@H = minors, heart shortage|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mug: or just three-suited, not minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mug: 4@C natural, five clubs, 4@H cue-bid, clubs agreed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: a singleton? bad idea when it is the king- but on way to 6 clubs now|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: 4NT RKCB, 5@D three|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mug: expects the @SK to be wrong now, and singleton is possible|pg||
nt|mug: this is a little worrying for England, he may play South for club length and finesse that way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: tends to suggest that club queen with North but maybe thats just me|pg||
nt|mug: but @S10 from shortage was an obvious lead, regardless of trump holding|pg||
nt|mug: percentage in clubs (other things equal) is @CK and run @C10, picking up four in the North hand|pg||
nt|the_boss: Danailov is out of the table, I think he is not feeling good today|pg||
nt|mug: but that's playing South for 10 red cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i wouldnt be so keen on 10x if I held club Queen - would try passive heart|pg||
nt|mug: how about this line|pg||
nt|odysseus69: would lead singleton 10 for sure|pg||
nt|mug: @SA, @HK, @CA, @CK, @HA, ruff a heart|pg||
nt|mug: combining @CQ doubleton and @HQ falling in three|pg||
nt|mug: probably not right, on reflection|pg||
nt|Aurora:  Many thanks @H to all commentators, operators and kibitzers, see you in about 20 minutes for the next session. |pg||
nt|mug: because you need the third club to have four hearts|pg||
nt|mug: no, I think he has to take his best guess at the @CQ|pg||
