nt|rv:  a few players have tendency to open 1n on all sorts of 15-17 to simplify bidding, my view is to open off-shape only when you anticipate posssible rebid problem or have too much values in short suits|pg||

nt|NKGupt: i wud open if @h and @s's were interchanged|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|key1809: routine 4@h, pretty flatty session so far|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rv: here 1@h is 4+cards|pg||
nt|Psyck:  It is basically a sum of HCP, controls, lengths of longest two suits, and difference in length of longest & shortes suit...need 26 zar to open|pg||
nt|key1809: that is some overcall|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|rv: if West bids 1@h and if North had 4/5@s some play X to show 4@s and 1@s as 5+cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv: did Jassem actually bid 1@d?|pg||
nt|key1809: im shocked at that overcall, unpassed pd, is this real|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: this bidding is too surreal|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rv: Roy's 5@h is very poor as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|key1809: thats a very lucky make, |pg||
nt|rv: he has shown his hand must be in FP situation, why not just pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I think he bid 5@h since he is not sure if it is FP situation|pg||
nt|key1809: why not x, with that @s holding, what holdings to you x|pg||
nt|rv: FP=forcing pass|pg||
nt|rv: yes either double to clearly suggest penalty or pass if at all you want to consult partner|pg||
nt|rv: bidding 5@h seems too unilateral|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: I presume he wasn't sure it was FP situation|pg||
nt|key1809: for me pass is equally sending a wrong messege to pd, and he may himself bid 5@H, and be dissapointed when he looks at !AQJ in dummy|pg||
nt|rv: I much prefer 3@d instead of 2@d in previous rd to clearly show power raise|pg||
nt|key1809: no losing option play available here for declarer to go wrong|pg||
nt|Psyck:  EW CC does mention aggresive overcall at 1-level :)|pg||
nt|rv: only very imaginative @CT lead would have given losing option|pg||
nt|rv: maybe Jassem would have found it if he was sitting East|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|key1809: @s finesse not gaining, niether is ruffing finesse gaining, all he requires is one of the 2 things correct, @d ace onside or no loser in @c;s|pg||
