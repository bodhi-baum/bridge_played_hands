nt|gracelin: Wow, 3NT maybe cold for NS|pg||
nt|kareno: I think it is - west thinking about a save, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Even a D lead won't help since East has only 2D and West's only entry CA will be knocked out before the suit is established.|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like down only 3.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: But north wants out!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: soith bids 3NT just in case 2S had been a range ask.  North retreated since his intention was to sign-off in 3C.|pg||
nt|kareno: No guts no glory :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Uh oh.  Not a good save over 4@c :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: I don't think the 4H bid was wise when south bid 3NT over 3H.  Why sacrifice against 4C?|pg||
nt|gracelin: luckily for West, he escaped a double |pg||
pc|dA|nt|gracelin: I can only say that south was very kind not to double.  |pg||
