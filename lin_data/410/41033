mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|aardv:  on this board, Mike Lawrence is right|pg||

nt|vugraphzbh: He did open 1@D and bidding proceeded as in the bidding box|pg||

nt|athene: beginning with the @D10 is not so unreasonable, if you think west will have the diamond length|pg||
nt|athene: he pretty much needs to put east with the @DA though, since he can't stand a spade through the king|pg||
nt|aardv:  if spades are 5-2, vacant places say that west is more likely than east to have three diamnods, in a ratio 3:2|pg||
