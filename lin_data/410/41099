nt|vugraphzbh: thx|pg||
nt|kit: nice hand to hold opposite strong NT|pg||
nt|jkdood: Specs like 7N|pg||
nt|wstuart: 7NT because @D come in, but they will likely play 6NT.|pg||
nt|kit: will likely just get to 7NT, which makes when diamond position becomes known.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jkdood: And Canada gained 5 on setting 2@S so takes the lead by 1|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|wstuart: without the @DT it's a terribad grand|pg||
nt|wstuart: with the @DT it's about even odds|pg||
mb|5D|nt|wstuart: 2NT was puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: So Meck has shown his hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|kit: not clear where he is headed with the 5@D call|pg||
nt|kit: I guess he can torture partner some more by following with 6@S|pg||
nt|wstuart: looking for a 4-3 or 5-3 @D fit to use his doubleton @S perhaps?|pg||
nt|jkdood: IS he sure N has the missing ace?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|kit: aha -- Rodwell came back with torture bid of his own.|pg||
nt|jkdood: If N has not shown this Ace it could be a reason to accept the grand try coming|pg||
nt|kit: Keep in mind that North doesn't know South has grand ideas yet.  North thinks it a question of a small slam, or which small slam.|pg||
nt|kit: Now Meckstroth may be afraid to make the 6@S torture bid for fear it will be passed after Rodwell bids 5@S|pg||

mc|13|nt|wstuart: @D come in so it will make but the grand needs to be 58% to even out the IMP odds for a small slam.|pg||
nt|kit: Probably a bit better than that when you throw in squeeze potential.|pg||
nt|jkdood: UNless you pull sweater and tell pd which wayto play @D|pg||
nt|wstuart: perhaps a bit better if long @H and @D in the same hand, true|pg||
nt|wstuart: 58% + the red suit squeeze might get up to 60% but prob not|pg||
