nt|medwards: Hello|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Hi Mike|pg||
nt|medwards: Hi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Welcome back all|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So, at the halfway point, Nickell has a small lead in this match|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|medwards: Will South open?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: one vul game swing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|prospero1:  This is the third 11-count I have seen them pass on Red, so they don't quite open everything|pg||
nt|kareno: Hello all from Tacoma :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: segment 3 of 4 in the quarterfinals of USA2 at the 2013 Team Trials|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|medwards: Bad 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  1@d by N, of course, is nebulous, 10-15 with 2+ diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  2@h raise is 11-13, no singletons worth mentioning|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: winner plays the winner of Diamond-Spector|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Hi Karen|pg||
pc|d3|nt|prospero1:  Diamond was leading that match by 34 at the break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: EW play 3rd/5th or 3rd/low but std carding|pg||
nt|kareno: Really hard for west to balance vulnerable despite knowing his side has values because n/s quit at two-level|pg||
nt|prospero1:  There was an amusing hand in the 2nd quarter when both Hampson and Gitelmen psyched in third seat and produced matching -1400's|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|kareno: Sorry I missed that one!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|medwards: me too|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Just because Meckwell stop at 2-level doesn't mean you have more than half of deck ... they can get you if you step out at the wrong time|pg||
nt|medwards: Didnt the Italians win many tournaments with out a psych|pg||
nt|kareno: They were older :)|pg||
nt|medwards: Thats what I hear|pg||
pc|c6|nt|prospero1:  Their bidding methods were so far advanced from their contemporaries that they did not need to|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|medwards: They also had large feet|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't psych - it's rolling dice - if I think I'm outclassed, then I may swing but not that way|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	Psyching is not an act of desperation though, it can often be a useful tactical tool, even at the highest level.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Welcome Adam Kaplan, who never psyches|pg||
nt|prospero1:  There are certain pairs that have a more, say, freewheeling style|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	Suuure. Hi Scott.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Hi Adam|pg||
nt|kareno: You mean the foot soldiers?	Not all of them did that sort of thing (though some might disagree)|pg||
nt|kareno: Adam :)|pg||
nt|medwards: I know but I could not resist the comment|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Adam, I joked the other day when you picked up that 30-count that it was the best hand you had held in your life. Was I correct?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|mtvesuvius:  Actually no -- I had a 33-count in Philadelphia in 2010 and went -50.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Did better on this one|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	So I was quite glad to go plus this time.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: his declarer play has improved since then|pg||
nt|prospero1:  :)|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius:	I don't think I would invite with Rodwell's hand even playing 15-17 NTs, but it would be close then. Not surprisingly, 2@H is the limit here.|pg||

mb|p|nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	In this position, I believe their 1N is actually 15-17 (3rd red)?|pg||
nt|prospero1:  In the trials 20 years ago that hand would have been a passout|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  1N 14-16, upgrade here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Everybody plays Rusinow these days|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I think Meckwell also lead Q from KQx, so can reserve K for power lead|pg||

nt|prospero1:  @c4 is upside-down attitude|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I believe Rusinow was invented in the '70s by a man named Smith. It fell out of favor for a while but is back.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  But now, he doesn't have count in clubs, so he doesn't know the @cJ is coming down|pg||
nt|kareno: Actually, if they don't cash out now, Berkowitz can diagnose the heart position and make the contract.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Actually, they need to cash out, because Berkowitz could guess to smush the @hT9 by leading the @hJ from dummy|pg||
nt|prospero1:  parallel comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Sontag and Meckstroth have reputations as two of the fastest players in the world|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: but there's a lot at stake here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Berkowitz and Rodwell are a bit more deliberate anyway|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I've got Meckstroth and Rodwell upside down|pg||
nt|kareno: Hard to play bridge upside down|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Levin opened 1@h with the E cards, so Pepsi got to play 1N as N and made 2|pg||

nt|prospero1:  It was important that Rodwell shifted to a heart, rather than a spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Apparently, Rusinow is as old as 1930 (and was of course invented by Mr. Rusinow)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|prospero1:  Spade, rather than a heart|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kareno: It's hard to imagine anyone with a different name inventing it to call it Rusinow!!|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kareno: That looks like a choice of games... John?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Meck wrote something. This must show a specific way to raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|prospero1:  So, 3N or 4@h?|pg||
nt|prospero1:  3@s passes it back|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I call that the transfer of responsibility.  You pick and if it's wrong, it's on you :)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Spade spots are just good enough for second stopper|pg||
nt|kareno: Either game should make|pg||
nt|medwards: Its probably right to play in notrump as east in short in spades|pg||
mb|3N|nt|prospero1:  and 3N is only nine tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Meckstroth took our advice :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: In the other room, I'd do whichever one made Pepsi the declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kareno: There is, of course, an extra trick playing in the 4-4 fit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Meck may have chosen based on need to go to the bathroom|pg||
nt|prospero1:  But you need 2 extra to justify it at IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: lead is 2nd from nothing|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Different decision at matchpoints or Board-a-match|pg||
nt|kareno: You just want to play the safer which in this case is 3nt|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Both were looking at hearts which might be problematic with a 41 break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: IMO, and this may be heretic, but as far as declarers go, of these 8, Pepsi is the best|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: so I'd let him play it|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not at all sure of that.  I'd pick Rodwell myself|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I'm not the best judge ... they're all lightyears better than I am|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: all great, to be sure.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|prospero1:  There will be a lot of thinking of alternative layouts here, but as far as I can see, all roads lead to nine tricks|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: For the specs, with east having only two spades, there is no running the spade suit for e/w.  May I recommend laying out the cards in that suit on a table and trying it ... a good ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: an imp to Nickell?|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, east will hold tight to the clubs.|pg||

nt|kareno: The penultimate board :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|prospero1:  1@c 16+ unbalanced or 18+ balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  1@h is 8+ HCP, 5+ hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: standard decision by berkowitz|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Natural auction subsequent|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Berk showed 9-11 5-3-3-2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: lots of hcp, two balanced hands  no need to inquire about @hs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|prospero1:  Sorry for wrong explanation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: apparently 1NT did ask about shape|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I think Sontag is responsible for pairing strong NT with precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Rod asked Alan if he's shown anything in particular|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kareno: Thanks to Scott, our excellent operator.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Before that the "standard precision" used a weak NT|pg||
nt|prospero1:  One of the strengths of precision is that on hands like this you can conceal a great deal about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to BBO for this wonderful platform for watching bridge matches (and playing and bidding and teaching too!)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks to my cocommentators for their excellent insights|pg||
nt|kareno: And to the specs for keeping us awake!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: restart scheduled for 6:10, 40 minutes from now|pg||
nt|kareno: And especially to USBF for allowing us to watch their premier events, particularly to Jan Martel for organizing them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: if you don't know how good a job Jan Martel does, let me tell you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Herculean efforts|pg||
nt|kareno: I'll be skipping the last quarter - headed out to watch baseball.  My team (Las Vegas 51's are in Tacoma and so am I)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: catch a foul ball for us Karen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: www.usbf.org is the general website for this event|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Have fun, Karen|pg||
nt|kareno: They've given me seats behind the screen.  They must know I was hit by a foul ball once in Chicago (also watching my team there)|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks for the good wishes, folks.  |pg||
nt|prospero1:  I'm looking in vain for a ninth trick for Sontag|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Rodwell burning the little grey cells wanting to beat this vul game|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Pepsi Seamon bid game on 43, so we are exactly tied for the 13 boards so far this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: vul, not vul, I've vugraphed like 345 boards this week|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: one more session then I get to go see if it improved my bridge any|pg||
pc|s2|nt|prospero1:  Rodwell's @hJ an upside-down suit preference signal showing a club card|pg||
nt|kareno: So had Sonty played the heart queen first, I imagine Rodwell would duck, no?  And come to this position anyway|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I think Sontag's only hope is to somehow endplay Rodwell, but I don't see it|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: try with his pard|pg||
nt|ritong: doesn t meck look a bit exposed with the @cs and the @dQ?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|prospero1:  Yes, I guess it's Meckstroth he'll have to endplay|pg||

nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  And a diamond through when in with the @hJ would have broken it up, if he followed up with another one when in with the club|pg||
