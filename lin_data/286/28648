nt|3for3:  i have no clue what is right|pg||

nt|dbl me:  If these situations didn't come up, players wd give up preempting.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  I wd preserve partnership by passing.|pg||
nt|3for3:  even if he knew his partners hand, not clear to bid 7, opps could have a ruff, or partner might misguess trump|pg||
nt|3for3:  so pass = lose 3, 7@S = win 8|pg||
