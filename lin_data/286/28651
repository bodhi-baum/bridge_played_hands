nt|prospero1:  Precision pairs can jump to show offensive values and not worry that they are overstating defensive values|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Meckstroth can recover something by doubling -- but he heard the opponents get there voluntarily|pg||

pc|d6|nt|kit: In fact, defeating 5@D might be difficult|pg||
nt|prospero1:  trump lead is a good start|pg||

mb|p|nt|prospero1:  I agree|pg||
nt|medwards: Other table on 52|pg||
nt|kit: Not playing a strong 1@C I can understand the 1NT opening, since rebid is awkward, but playing a strong 1@C the rebid looks easy.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: he looks like a man with no tools|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|prospero1:  Maybe as a passed hand 2@c then 3m is to play|pg||

nt|medwards: or 5-5|pg||
nt|kit: might be both minors, might be to diamonds -- I don't know.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I think passed hand 3m to 1N is invitational, so no direct transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|prospero1:  But they do have 2@s as size or clubs, so maybe this shows minors|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, 3 of either minor looks like it will make.|pg||
nt|kit: It seems like Meckstroth's call is pretty easy whatever it means, so why the delay?|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe he thinks it is something else|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He may be deciding whether to bid 3@d|pg||

nt|kit: This lead may present problems.  Declarer has to take immediate pitch, and then he may get forced.  |pg||
nt|prospero1:  There is room for this to show minors, because he can use 2@s to get to 3@c, just like if he were an unpassed hand|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: www.usbf.org is the website for this event|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  3@c is standard Stayman, so 3@s Smolen|pg||
nt|robinswr: would u double 3@s:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I believe they play smolen here|pg||
nt|kit: Of course not clear how to play it -- East won't know everything is perfect.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Bleeding kibitzers to the other table|pg||
nt|medwards: me too|pg||
nt|robinswr: kit doubled 3@s in a different auction, they redoubled and made four|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Not entirely unforeseeable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i've been at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: is Sontag really considering something?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: believe it or not yes, but he also went to the restroom|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Seems to me that thinking is an overbid.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  It is 22-23, but Berkowitz hasn't given him any encouragement|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will try queen of spades at trick 2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|prospero1:  12 tricks here, but not a good slam|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: close|pg||

pc|c4|nt|prospero1:  I'm not sure if Rodwell's @c3 is encouraging clubs or surrogate Reverse smith, since he couldn't make a Smith signal in spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: it's nothing, i missed the card|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Meckstroth doesn't have a diamond to lead in any case|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he threw a diamond|pg||

nt|kfay: 4@C would show clubs, 4@d and 4@H are transfers, and 4@S would be diamonds.|pg||
nt|kfay: 4@D-4@H-4NT would be a keycard-type bid.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|kfay: So systemically I'm not sure what he's thinking about looks like he was endplayed into a pass.|pg||
nt|kfay: 3@C was puppet stayman, yes.  3N just said 'I don't have any 4c or 5c-major'|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c6|pc|s8|nt|kfay: He could have bid 4@D-4@H-5N as a smolen pick-a-slam bid|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kfay: So my guess is Weinstein was thinking about the 4@D-4@H-5N option|pg||
