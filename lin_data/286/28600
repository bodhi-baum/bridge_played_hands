nt|kit: Now we shall see -- declarer may choose to lead a diamond now, which will be very fatal.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|kit: he is properly running the clubs, since he doesn't really need the entries for anything|pg||
nt|barnets: dc would have been better had he kept the @H10|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfk: Becker is of course well known for his conservitivism :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|barnets: Becker is very conservative player|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: 3@H for me too Peter -- and for voice commentators in other oom|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|pef: looks like confusion over the meaning of 2n by cheek here|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: in written commentary  Kit Woolsey said  "I think pass is the aggressive bid - 3@H is the conservative bid"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: he clearly meant it as two places to play, grue seems to have thought it was natural|pg||
nt|pef: looks like 4h e/w is touch and go.  9 tricks (5 hearts, 2 diamonds, 1 club, and one ruff in dummy are easy, but the 10th trick is hard|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pef: best after winning this is simply ace and a diamond for a peaceful down 1|pg||

nt|kit: Now let's see if the lead-directing 1@C opening is respected.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: lead changes once again|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: So this will be down 3 -- but no disaster, since the same unfavorable lie of the cards in spades is the favorable lie of the cards in hearts.|pg||

nt|barnets: maybe|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: No danger of getting too high -- Martel has complete trash.|pg||
nt|kit: The problem with the 4@C splinter is that if they belong in 3NT they can no longer get there.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2@D was an inverted minor showing a  decent hand with diamond support usually game forcing except when either side is  min|pg||
mb|4H|an|Illegible written explanation|mb|p|nt|kit: I don't like this call -- would not give any encouragement at all on Martel's hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe keycard or a cue ? who knows|pg||

mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kit: some are suggesting 4@H is ace asking -- but considering South's thought and 4@S call, it doesn't appear that way.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: cant be ace asking as you say from 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: uh oh -- it looks like Martel thought it was ace-asking but Zia didn't.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzfk: Zia: "I may have *****d this up" |pg||
nt|kit: So Martel thought Zia had 3 keycards, and 5@C was queen of trumps ask|pg||
nt|barnets: this is the second time they have bid slam off two aces this tournament|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: 4 spades was confirmed as keycard, 5@c 1/4 |pg||
nt|kit: And Zia apparently thought 4@H and 5@C were Q-bids.|pg||
nt|kit: two wrongs did not make a right on this hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Zia knew the 4@s was keycard, it appears he simply jumped to slam, perhaps without counting*|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kit: 4@S was the RKC call?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: But West is perhaps wondering how that is possible?|pg||
nt|kit: But it can't be much else.|pg||
nt|kit: must be for diamonds -- if East wanted to keycard for spades, he would have bid 3@S first to avoid ambiguity.|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say 4@H is keycard in diamonds maybe 4N is keycard in spades|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe thats what west is thinking|pg||
