nt|Drewsky: Thank you, Al|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil: 4@s is possibly 800 with best defense, but could Moss x it? |pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: if opener has @cs, the hand likely belongs to EW if he has @ds, less clear|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S would also be preempt|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|phil: dubious Fred sits anyway|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Drewsky: down 3 or 4, but enough to clinch the match because of the double dummy result in the other room.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  116 [3@CS+1]  Gitelman-Moss playing Reverse Flannery responses   so  1@D-P-2@H   but Willenken uses that go cue 2@S|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|jbgood:  or can S find a low @d?|pg||
