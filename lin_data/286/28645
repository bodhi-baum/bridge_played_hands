nt|Vugraphzfc: i thought most of the guys were like children :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: bridge speaking, maybe not debbie|pg||
mb|4H|nt|prospero1:  So, an eccentric 1N from Moss, and Platnick's 2@c promises a major in addition to clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  South's double appears to be a negative double of clubs, although some play it is Stayman here|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: fred might send the cube|pg||
mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Preempting sometimes makes it more likely that you will score a side Q on defense.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He has two chances to do so|pg||
nt|dbl me:  :-)|pg||
nt|reisig: Will he lead a @h?|pg||
nt|prospero1:  This will be ugly, but, hey, only 50 an undertrick|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|prospero1:  Brad takes your advice, Richard|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dbl me:  routine unblock coming|pg||
nt|dbl me:  :-)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So on 16, Greco did open 1@h, then tried 3N, which didn't fetch on a club lead, so 10 IMPs to Spector|pg||
nt|dbl me:  That result will certainly perpetuate Brad's action style...|pg||
nt|phil: doesn't seem that crazy to me|pg||
nt|ritong: was not|pg||
nt|ritong: simply worked out great|pg||
nt|dbl me:  It makes all the difference when you have a suit ready to rattle off|pg||
nt|prospero1:  It worked for an odd reason ... Platnick showed both his suits over 1N, which warned him off of 3N|pg||
nt|reisig: To me ..the Queen is automatic here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Brad says sorry|pg||
nt|phil: partner isn't returning the suit from AJT|pg||
nt|dbl me:  The J wd be bizarre lacking the 10|pg||
nt|phil: in this auction, yes|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Spector simply overcalled 1@s, so Greco didn't see the club lead coming|pg||
nt|phil: if he doesnt unblock, the defense isn't dead|pg||
nt|dbl me:  any ideas what is concerning him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: lots heavy breathing by moss and diamond|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Diamond is at least going to tie the result at the other table|pg||
nt|reisig: Henri is ALWAYS right!   :)|pg||
nt|dbl me:  hehe|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Hampson did double 3N there, and Becker ran to 4@d, which they did not double|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: waiting for brad to turn over card|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Perhaps trying to decide if he is finally going to unblock|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: has hand on chin looking at cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: up down up down with hand of cards|pg||
nt|dbl me:  His play only made sense if he thot pd was unblocking for him...now proven an impossibilty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: okay its turned|pg||
pc|d7|nt|prospero1:  last chance|pg||
nt|dbl me:  lol, Fred tried to old chestnut of the "surprise" dJ.  :-)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Other scores at the first break ... Kranyak by 8 over Fleisher, Gordon by 6 over Nickell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: deep sigh by Moss|pg||
nt|dbl me:  At imps, the odds had to be hugely favoring the initial Q unblock imo|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I glanced in on the Fleisher vs Kranyak match and there were something like ten pushes on the first thirteen boards|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond must be wondering what all the angst is ... after all, nobody has pitched a club, so he doesn't have any realistic shot at making it|pg||
nt|phil: feels like an overthink in progress|pg||
nt|dbl me:  At the table, it's amazing what demons can surface in your mind on defense...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond sighing now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: fred looks like hes napping and platnick cool as ever :)|pg||
nt|dbl me:  He may check for monsters under his bed tonight.   ;-)|pg||
nt|ritong: fred tries to stay zen|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfc: now Fred says sorry and he is thinking and Diamond laughs|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Platnick has to be one of the most apparently-unflappable players around|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now Fred shakes his head to clear cobwebs :)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Might as well pitch a heart at this point, pard has stopped you from running them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I have done four days and never shows any sign just like a smooth engine|pg||
nt|prospero1:  A club would be fatal|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|dbl me:  a truly admirable trait in any form of competition|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: diamond says now is his turn to think|pg||
nt|phil: this table is going to get into serious time trouble with more boards like this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now diamond says sorry|pg||
nt|prospero1:  They were in time trouble yesterday|pg||
nt|phil: which pair? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 94 min now|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond Platnick|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Although it was mostly Milner doing the damage|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Amazing turn of events, all based on deciding that a "routine" unblock was far from that...|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Hey, even I might check for monsters under the bed tonight|pg||

nt|phil: a spade is now safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: brad apologise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: platnick giggle silently|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond will hold this to down 1 ... can pitch his spades and Gitelman will be endplayed|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond knows now that Gitelman has a spade card|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Unfortunately this deal may throw Fred and Brad off a bit in the coming boards|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|nt|prospero1:  They also play Reverse Flannery jumps over 1@c, so they don't need 2@h natural after the 1N rebid ...|pg||
nt|prospero1:  That bid can be used to show 4441's|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|prospero1:  1@d 0-6|pg||
nt|prospero1:  0-7, sorry, mistype|pg||
nt|dbl me:  The systemic explanations much-appreciated.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Platnick could have rebid 1N to treat this like a 18-19 balanced hand, but instead rebids 2@c|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I would guess that 2@c shows six much more often than five|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Seems like a simple raise to 3@c describes Diamond's hand well|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|prospero1:	OK, so the 1@s overcall tips him to treating the hand in this way|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He could have made a takeout double, but that would have risked the result in the other room, getting to diamonds|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond is angling to get to a red 3N, which looks like it will fail by two tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dbl me:  For developing players...don't be so fast to rebid NT with a single stopper in overcaller's suit...often pd shd be declaring.|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Without Gitelman's raise to 2@s, a 3@c bid would show some game interest ... after the raise, it could just be weak and competitive|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|prospero1:  Hence Diamond bidding 2N to show something|pg||
nt|prospero1:  However, I agree with Richard, you like to put Ax down on the table|pg||
nt|prospero1:  @sJ lead is Rusinow, which most experts lead against NT when they have 4+ cards in the suit|pg||
nt|dbl me:  ...it combines well with pd's KQJx.   ;-)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  There are certainly some holdings where you would rather declare with Ax, such as Jxx coming down on dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: director in here and says only board 4 after an hour is not good|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|dank: but you can see the headache it has created for the opponents, as Spector has a very awkward hand that he would have much prefered to open 1@C and have the auction to himself|pg||
mb|p|nt|dank: The fact that Hampson is limited to 15 or 16 HCP for his 1@D opener gives him a little bit of safety to open the bidding with this.|pg||
nt|dank: Believers in this super aggressive style feel that the gains of giving the opponents problems outweigh the losses by occasionally getting a little bit too high in the bidding.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: director standing here|pg||
nt|dbl me:  I am a fan of Rusinow, not least because when pd leads an A, you needn't wonder about the K|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d!|an|strong|nt|phil: the Ace lead in Rusinow seems to have some variations though, no? |pg||
nt|prospero1:  It has a slightly different purpose against NT ... it allows you to lead the K to show a power holding where you want partner to unblock ...|pg||
nt|prospero1:  And lead the A from AK empty if you want to look at the dummy|pg||
nt|phil: against suits, rather|pg||
mb|r!|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Each pair of course needs to work out the specifics|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  So Gitelman Moss do what many top pairs do and revert to their weak NT defense against a third-seat 1N opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Some of the specs may be interested in the logic of that...|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Phil, there is a lot of variation in Rusinow lead agreements against suits|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|phil: they started that about 5 years ago when everyone was opening 1N in 3rd on jus about anything|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Some do it all the time, some only up to a certain level, and some only if they have shown length in the suit|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzfc: brad says sorry if i should have x|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Even when 3rd seat opener is not joking, the two initial passes make it more likely fourth seat is looking at a great hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 62 min left in this set|pg||
nt|ritong: a very unusual auction, here|pg||
nt|dbl me:  So basically, make a double for penalties when you most wish it were so...|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Wonder if Gitelman was making a game try, or if he thought Brad only had four hearts for not bidding them over the redouble|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|prospero1:  Yes, Richard|pg||
nt|phil: might depend on the forcing nature of Brad's pass|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Usual agreement after a penalty double is that pass if forcing through 2@d or 2@s ... depends on partnership|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|prospero1:  Here they would have been in a force, I'm pretty sure|pg||

nt|dank: opponents open the bidding|pg||
nt|dank: in Hampson's defense, what happened was unlucky for him -- North had enough not only to "bury" him in 3@S but also that E/W did not have an easy slam|pg||

nt|prospero1:  These guys know each other well, so it is perhaps not as surprising that some of the odd actions are being duplicated in the other room|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dbl me:  It can be awkward when pd was jumping with 5h and a near-Yarb|pg||
nt|ritong: the overcall looks sound  the question is: would i be happy to be raised to game?  if the answer is yes, overcall|pg||
pc|s8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ritong: it of course has secondary consequences, about lead etc|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|h3|nt|prospero1:  This 4@h might not have done so well on @hA, @h ... it helps to have more than eight trumps when you have less than half the deck|pg||
nt|dbl me:  The 5 small diamonds makes the overcall very high-percentage imo|pg||
nt|ritong: but nonetheless, the primary goal of an overcall is to get raised, as high as possible imho|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Spector had wound up 4@h, but Becker pulled. Platnick never had that chance in this room|pg||
