nt|kareno: A quiet claim |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 45 IMPs, 31 boards - time running out|pg||
nt|prospero1:  2@d three suited, short diamonds|pg||
nt|dbl me:  There may be a bit of tension in the air...operator?|pg||
nt|medwards: 35 isnt it|pg||
mb|2D|an|!|nt|prospero1:  "4415 missing a card", 10-15 HCP|pg||
nt|kareno: Right 35 IMPs - lot closer.  |pg||
nt|kareno: My math days are behind me, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: There is. JD asked Eric where was the J of clubs|pg||
mb|d|an|!|nt|prospero1:  Double just shows an opening hand with diamonds|pg||
nt|dbl me:  oops, prob. not the best question to ask|pg||
nt|medwards: I think an imp a board is in reach|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Might be 45 or so after 43|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfc: John Diamond|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, that figures to be a good-sized swing|pg||
nt|prospero1:  3@h would be a shape invitation over a pass ... may be more preemptive after a double|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Doesn't look like an invite with @dKJ, but Platnick thinks it is|pg||
pc|d5|nt|prospero1:  Looks like a make|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|dbl me:  43 was the type of board to really test a partnership...let's see if EW start living on the edge|pg||
nt|kareno: This is a little on the edge.  He has to guess the heart position now.  |pg||
nt|prospero1:  yes, opening bid with diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Not 100% it shows an opening bid opposite a passed hand|pg||

pc|s9|pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Any discussion at the table about the values for double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: no|pg||
nt|kareno: Slightly antipercentage play in hearts but he may now be looking for swings|pg||
nt|prospero1:  There are things they do differently opposite a passed hand, and I don't nearly know all of them|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Yes, K...MB that is living on the edge|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|swanson:  The defensive sequence in spades tends to imply that North had five spades which compensates for the diamond length shown in the auction.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  The problem arises when your teammates bring back a rocket, and you have to aplogize|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kareno: Thanks, Luz, for a great job operating|pg||

nt|ahollan1: then USA2 final  30 tomorrow and 60 monday|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: it is a 90 board match. The winner will play against the loser of USA1 tomorrow afternoon and monday|pg||
nt|prospero1:  A Meckwell 3N ... I agree with voice commentary that Platnick should have doubled|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|prospero1:  Classic situation where both hands were limited and you know suits are breaking badly|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|swanson:  West made a good decision to lead a low diamond.  The play might get interesting after the @DQ lead.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  It's not going to get sent back, and he's very unlikely to make an overtrick|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Wd you play that despite the spade rebid the double requests a spade lead?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|prospero1:  I think so ... you can't be doubling without spades being locked up|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think so - though it might just suggest spades tied up and values outside|pg||
nt|dbl me:  However, that is just the sort of situation wherein pd may be void...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|prospero1:  I've run into that before|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|prospero1:  ten IMPs as expected on 43|pg||
nt|kareno: I doubled on such an auction in my first World Championship and my partner shot me a look of pure terror.  She was void.  We beat it anyway|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Virtue was its own AND your team's reward!|pg||
nt|prospero1:  You want a nice calm 1N making 2 on the first board to get into a rhythm|pg||
