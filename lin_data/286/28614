nt|jjsb:  4@h will be played now even with @d stopper west don have a 3nt bid with a 65... |pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|westjava: wow, they fly too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|jjsb:  im not totally ssurprised if u see at west hand u just want to bid ... its always hard to stop low with hand like that |pg||
nt|westjava: I believe 2@D shows 1-suiter and 2@H is p/c|pg||
nt|westjava: so 3@C here implies @C single suiter|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3N|nt|gracelin: This is last board of the 1st match.  The player played fast.  Next match will start in exactly one hour from now.	or 4:45 pm local time|pg||
nt|gracelin: who cares about stopper in opponent's suit ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gracelin: if West trusts south bidding and lead HQ, 3NT is making, but I doubt West will let south play it|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am also surprised that Sacul can only raise to 2s with his 4 good trumps.  They don't play ergen ?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Bergen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: south may run to 5c now if get doubled|pg||

pc|c3|nt|jjsb:	not clear deicision by East i admit i tend to double but deicision like that are just extremely tough |pg||
nt|jjsb:  the problem in sough is that dont want to double cause u have just 0 looking defensive card ... |pg||
nt|jjsb:  but also u just dont have necesserely good card to win a contract at level 5 |pg||
