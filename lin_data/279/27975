nt|ianmcc: down to 1!|pg||
nt|the daa:  which is a fun finish one hopes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: David did say it would be Quail +5|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|the daa:  That was my prediction when they were down by 20:)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ianmcc: could be 4@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D a mixed raise?|pg||
nt|the daa:  east's card will look big given his diet|pg||
nt|the daa:  I would settle to pass it out though|pg||

nt|ahollan1: when is that ever right?|pg||
nt|the daa:  hard to fathom, perhaps we need to electric prod the operator|pg||
nt|vugrapha7: don't think delcarer can untangle his tricks here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|the daa:  the reason I liked KH before is that if it holds you can cash the QD and play another H|pg||
nt|vugrapha7: so still -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's true -- since Ewart still has trump  Ebery can't do it all|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mrdct:  looks like NS need to go positive here to win the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: didn't we think there was better defense available against 3@S?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  EW could misguess clubs in 4@H|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h close for E/W. If 1 down, swings match|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: oh that would just increase Braithwaite lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|the daa:  they would have to be propelled there somehow|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  i wonder if 3@c shows the better raise than 3@d|pg||
nt|the daa:  I hope not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Braithwaite has 0.1 cf|pg||
