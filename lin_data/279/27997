pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|gsper:  A kib: "why no double?"|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North's 4S was another example of the advance sacrifice. Bidding 4@S before East could express her hand's strength.|pg||
nt|gsper:  Presumably meaning X by W|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Yes, that is 2 consecutive deals where 4@S has escaped undoubled. Hard to see which hand was expected to double here, after West's 2@H raise.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  N/S play the strong 1NT. Townsend has chosen that opening  for pre-emptive reasons.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Also, he has the playing strength for 3NT if partner is that way inclined.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Close decision perhaps for South. The diamonds and poor hearts suggest 3NT, but he is weak in the black suits.|pg||

nt|vugraphzcn: The score in the other match is Tondel 32, de Botton 20|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  The text-books say '6 cards for a 2-level overcall', but many would bid 2@H. Ah, he tried an under-strength 1NT overcall.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2N|nt|BroLucius:  The previous hand was reminiscent of the last one in the 1st set. Spades bid, but a diamond lead (or switch) was the killer.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  West's Unusual Notrump may warn N/S of a bad heart break.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  South shows 5 hearts with a bid at this level but North has stoppers in the minor suits.|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Declarer may need four heart tricks for the contract.|pg||
