nt|rv: PS, now 2 down,original trump lead 3 down possible?|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: East's 4@h is a gross overbid, his double on opps GF auction showed other 2 suits, he doesn't have anything extra to take another bid |pg||

nt|rv: broadcasts in not best of conditions|pg||
mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|rv: Puneet has possibly treated his good 4 card suit as equivalent to 5 cards|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|bideshk:	again a overbid.. going 3 down with good def|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: East did have a tough bidding problem on 4@s, options were pass, double or 5@h|pg||
nt|rv: as cards are 4@s is cold and even 5@s might require a trump lead to beat|pg||
nt|bideshk:  even trump lead cannot save 5@s making as cards lies|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: with East hand I might have doubled with disastrous results, here South should have doubled 5@h with A, K and 4 trumps to boot|pg||
nt|rv: South's pass is too timid|pg||
nt|vugraphzat: it was a long pause by e and then by s so north was debarred from bid|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: if declarer guesses @c (likely), he is odds to make even 5@s|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|rv: bidder more likely to have distribution to back his bids rather than extra Queen or Jack|pg||

nt|rv: if North bids direct 3n on South's 1n, West needs to lead a @c or find switch before it is too late|pg||
nt|rv: match tied after this deal, good recovery by Rajputana|pg||
nt|rv: please note these are not top players in India, most of these players will struggle to even qualify for R16 or QFs in any national event|pg||
