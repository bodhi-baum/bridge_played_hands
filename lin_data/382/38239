mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  It might depend how they play a double there, for most it would be penalty but west has a good hand for a "card showing" double|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|3for3:  I prefer penalty...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|3for3:  if you have spades they are well placed.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|3for3:  Sanborn just raises, a sensible view |pg||
nt|jdonn:  Certainly she wanted to do something, so this must have seemed like the least of evils|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Hopefully east doesn't stretch to bid 4@H since north has an easy double of that. Declarer would have to do very well and need some help from the defense to only go down 1.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  A void is always tempting but QTx is not a good holding in a suit rebid on your left.|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Now she has to ruff a heart to hand and I think force out the lead trump. If the defense switches to diamonds she can lead clubs up twice.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I think she will realize there is no other option, leading diamonds or clubs now will clearly go down|pg||
nt|3for3:  counter intuitive to tap yourself here.  but it is ok since club finesses are proven|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: yeah, but she probably does suspect the KD is offside|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: still, unclear|pg||
nt|jdonn:  This may involve west discarding down to a singleton diamond king in certain variations, although she has to be careful since the finesse sure seems offside after a vulnerable overcall with KT9xx at best|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  Here it looks like a slam hand for NS in diamonds. Even a grand slam is reasonable perhaps, counting on setting up a long spade for a second heart discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i think it would make with trumps 2-1, but down on actual layout with 3-0 trumps and a heart lead|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|3for3:  plus you need 43 spades...|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Yeah the 3-0 diamond break will ruin it, too hard to ruff both clubs, and set up spades, and end in dummy after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|3for3:  id be happy to rest in 6|pg||
nt|jdonn:  On the auction, 7@D is probably only good enough played by south in order to protect from the heart lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|an| |nt|3for3:  even if it was just on 43 spades, I dont think 7 is percentage|pg||
mb|5D|an| |mb|p|nt|3for3:  opposite no encouragement Meyers will likely settle for 6|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jdonn:  Unless south can ask a specific question about spades she will essentially be guessing, no reason the club queen couldn't be in spades or something like that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|3for3:	or the queen of diamonds could be in spades :)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|h2|nt|jdonn:  Well it's not clear whether or not 4@H was keycard for diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jdonn:  I'd say probably not since north might have passed with no heart control over the double, and south might have confirmed all the keycards. But still not completely clear|pg||

nt|jdonn:  In order to survive the 3-0 trumps, the spades would have had to be QJ tight or QJx coming down|pg||
