nt|Vugraphzfc: Levitina is thinking|pg||

pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: more thinking|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I suppose west could play a heart now in hopes east has AJx, although I think then east would have thrown a club for sure to help prevent partner from playing clubs back|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jdonn:  South might even double 3NT on an invitational auction to attract a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jdonn:  West's 1NT bid is pretty normal these days, there are two big problems with 2@C. 1. It makes it very hard to get to hearts, and 2. 1NT limits your strength and 2@C doesn't.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jdonn:  Big big danger here, south might double 3NT for a spade lead. Then east would have to figure out to go to 4@D to avoid going for a number|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  Dangerous for EW|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jdonn:  I think south should have doubled. For one thing since the opponents invited you know your partner has some strength. More importantly, it is very important to you that partner leads a spade. Double graetly increases your chances of beating it.|pg||
nt|medwards: Agree|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||

nt|jdonn:  Just imagine for example that east held ATx of clubs, on north's perfectly normal club lead the contract may have been given away. That's the importance of south doubling for a spade lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|jdonn:  Interesting bidding problem over 1@S|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  South will definitely rebid clubs again, but probably have to give up at that point|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Especially after east bids hearts|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  So despite the great hand even 3@C was too high, unless the defense plays hearts and gives south two winners there|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Low diamond looks like the right play now, either to partner's queen, or partner ruffs which is very unlikely to be with a trick.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Migry as dummy is on a smoke break kibitzer is filling in |pg||
nt|jdonn:  A spade is save too but if south had the diamond queen left and later played it that might be awkward for west.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jdonn:  This won't be hard to defend, east can throw a million spades and west can throw a million diamonds.|pg||

nt|jdonn:  Ok thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: probably not a heart discard, we got a little behind and can't see irina's hand|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I'm sure we will get the result at the end, which we expect to be -1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Irina indeed still has 4 hearts and A9 of spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Kerri has all red cards|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  One issue now with north's bidding problem is not everyone would play 4@D as forcing, since some can cancel the game force into 4 of a minor if no one is able to bid 3NT in competition. So it's possible she is deciding between 4@D and 5@D|pg||
nt|jdonn:  and even 4@s|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Maybe 3NT is an option too if she thinks bidding 3@C first implied doubt. Very  hard to tell, it depends a lot on style.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:	I suspect she bid 5@D because either she knew or feared that 4@D wouldn't be forcing.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|shuster:	of course, who wouldn't bid clubs here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no way -- relay explores slam then stops in 5@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was hoping to learn more about NS system  their notes/cc just say  1@D-?  1N=RELAY, FG   2@C thru 3@D = art FG|pg||
nt|ritong: the first hurdle is ok now|pg||
nt|ritong: let s go to the second one|pg||
nt|shuster:  North has a pretty good idea at this point that her club holding is unsuitable for anything higher than 5@D.  |pg||
nt|shuster:  perhaps wondering whether 4@S is an offer to play|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ritong: uh oh|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|shuster:	So they probably play some sort of symetric relay.  The Joanna plays symetric relay in other partnerships and Granovetter is married to one of the pioneers of the system|pg||

nt|jdonn:  South has a nice hand but surely she is now done as the level of the auction has risen quickly|pg||
nt|jdonn:  West seems to essentially have given up on hearts, which is reasonable given her suit qualities. 3@D tends to deny four hearts else you would have rebid 2@H instead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  Interesting, east surely wanted to rebid spades but was worried her partner wouldn't have a club stopper and 3NT would be missed.|pg||

nt|shuster:  but she'd need to give up on the contract by pitching a spade now|pg||
nt|shuster:  she is thinking this long, so she is considering it|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: starting to wear on people |pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|jdonn:  On this one east will likely open 2@H and south overcall 2@S. I think then west and north will both raise their partners.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  South decides to go for game, not an awful contract but it won't make here.|pg||

nt|ritong: nice pressure bid by west|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ritong: i love it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  4@S could be set three on an initial diamond lead|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @Hx for blood?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: i guess that would just transfer natural @D trick and 2nd @D ruff|pg||
nt|shuster:  I was wondering if West might not underlead the setting trick in diamonds in case partner had started with two|pg||
nt|ritong: and the last @d still in the bag|pg||

mb|d|mb|2C|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|jdonn:  Pointed out to me that EW make 4@C so 4@S is a good save regardless, and here it pushes EW too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  North should definitely not bid 5@S here, it's pass or double|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  I don't like this 5@D bid at all, you already made EW guess and have no reason to think they were making.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|jdonn:  This looks like down 2, unless they block the diamonds and get endplayed or something weird like that, but I'm really not seeing it.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jdonn:  If north wanted to do anything she could have doubled 5@C, not that she is sure it's down, but in the context of a 4@S bid she has fair defense. 4@S might instead have been a weaker hand with 6 spades for example.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|ritong: 250 is 6 imps|pg||

nt|jdonn:  This will surely go 1@S p 4@S X, then west will probably escape to a suit, possibly via 4NT showing two places to play|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|d|nt|jdonn:  North opts for just 3@S, east will double anyway|pg||
nt|jdonn:  And maybe south will bid 4@S regardless?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:	It's not good for NS to defend 4@H when cold for 4@S|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|jdonn:  Maybe north was a bit gunshy after the last hand, it looks like an aggressive but normal raise to 4@S to me. 5 trumps and a singleton is pretty standard.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: best retort from spec:    Hann Solo|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|shuster:	potential swing here... the open room, N/S defended 4@H -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S 10-15, never 5(332)|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|an|2 pl to play|nt|ahollan1: 4N = 2 places to play|pg||
nt|ritong: painful hand for south here|pg||
nt|shuster:  North can double 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: even more painful when she can suspect @h shortage|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: suit preference time for north|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: normally  "obvious shift" rules apply|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if they still apply here|pg||
nt|shuster:  and a small swing to baker instead of a medium one.  There will not be a 14 imp swing on board 32, so I think we can safely congratule team Narasimhan on their win tonight!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i also wouldn't know what the obvious shift would be|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, i know that it s not sound to bid pard's shortages  however, sometimes you have to, when pard has told their story and won t bid again|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: but 4@S in context of limited opener can be pure preempt or	3-fit opening bid with no slam ambition|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: maybe Wolpert's high level DBL says 4@S has to be preemptive, shapely variety|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @H could still be 4432 around the table|pg||
nt|shuster:  declarer has successfully negotiated and endplay here and is poised to escape for -1|pg||
nt|shuster:  a low club exit is South's best chance, declarer could play low from dummy (playing south for A9x)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: we are trying our best to get the two matches on vug tomorrow|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jdonn:  West has a 1NT opener assuming 15-17|pg||
nt|jdonn:  East will transfer to hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|jdonn:  South may bid spades which west might double|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|jdonn:  I'm surprised west didn't double, you can't just assume partner has a 0 count, and if they do they may have a hand to pull anyway|pg||
