nt|TopWizard:  Why would W want a ruff here?|pg||
nt|kit: but would have been better to tell about the stiff diamond, oddly enough|pg||
nt|kit: Might be West's second trump trick -- West doesn't know.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  W has a virtually certain trump trick, so leading the @c10 seems indicated|pg||
nt|kit: well, it works better this time, but I don't think it is so clear at all|pg||
nt|kit: If East works out the shape, he may be able to deduce that giving the ruff can't gain.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  E is looking at a likely @c trick|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Knows partner has one high @h and 4 trumps of course|pg||
nt|kit: Problem is, if West has Axxx of spades (and no heart trick) the diamond ruff is right|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Do we expect the @cKing now?|pg||

nt|twcho: hi David|pg||
nt|DavidStern: Well I am a few metres from the tables where they are playing so maybe my view is better|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Garozzo declares "If you don't lead a singleton, you don't have one" :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: @h3 = encouraging|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Declarer will have to lead up to @d K, might do that since often will be in hand here and @c Q not an entry we see|pg||
nt|twcho: seems not the best choice by South with 5431 shape|pg||
nt|twcho: 4@s seems a better choice|pg||
nt|kit: No, certainly doesn't, particularly since presumably North doesn't have 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you think there was tunnel vision of south having such weak @S??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: 4@S reached in other room|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|twcho: we may have a new leader|pg||
nt|twcho: after this board|pg||
nt|kit: Will certainly be some IMPs -- question is will it be the big swing|pg||

nt|ahollan1: per Kit's comment that 2@S response denies 4@H -- Muller knows to unblock @HJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you read very dusty literature,  there was a distant pass where 2@S WAS the response with 4@S & 4@H|pg||

pc|h8|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: don't think anyone does that anymore, but i seem to recall one pair that lets opener choose which to show first -- but that is based on 2@C PROMISING at least 1 4-card major|pg||
