nt|kit: A spade lead dooms this contrac|pg||

nt|kit: spade lead not attractive, as partner didn't overcall 1@S so partner can't have 5 spades and enough to defeat the contract|pg||

nt|kit: why should he know that?  Opponents might simply not have enough strength.  Limited opening bid vs. passed hand.|pg||
