mb|3C|nt|3for3:  goldberg bids 3@C since partner is a PH|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:	Would always overcall 2, otherwise|pg||
nt|joest:  after which north has a textbook negative double.  It does two things: (a) brings spades into the picture and (b) permits her to bid diamonds later (if possible) while at teh same time having limited her hand by starting with a negative double|pg||
nt|joest:  fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:	This might buy it|pg||
nt|joest:  but I don't understand the pass by north in any event|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|joest:  if you are 4-6 I think you have to act.|pg||
nt|joest:  now ehn partner reopens with double you are guessing.  BTW one might question the reopening double with only a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|3for3:  Seamon's double is dangerous, what does she do over 3@S?|pg||
nt|joest:  she is catering to a penalty pass but running other risks|pg||
nt|joest:  or over 4@s?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest:  there is no way I would bid only 3 if someone had forced me to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  At least if partner bids 4, they have length|pg||
nt|joest:  so there is a reasonable play for 6@d here|pg||
nt|joest:  maybe not so reasonable|pg||
nt|3for3:  So, the good vulnerable game missed|pg||
nt|3for3:  Credit 3@C|pg||
nt|joest:  but game for sure|pg||

mb|2D|nt|joest:  i am presuming north has showed five spades (because no negative double)|pg||
nt|joest:  B/c of that I don't think Seamon should risk 3@c. That could get passed out with spades a better spot|pg||
nt|joest:  I could even make a case for bidding 4@s as south|pg||
nt|joest:  Partner could make it with as little as KJxxx of spades and out  -- a hand that would probably pass out 3@s|pg||
mb|d!|an|3 piece support|nt|joest:  4@s will not win you points in the master solvers club but it is a very practical bid|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|joest:  west's hand lacks a little high card strength to bid 5, and in any event she already jumped to 4|pg||

mb|3C|nt|joest:  Now Seamon might well cuebid here but remember partner could not overcall 1@s so it is unlikely she has anywhere near enough to contemplate more than a agme|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest:  3@c is dangerous bid at imps|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:	Yes, but harder to get in the modern era where doubles generally show extra values, and not the deck in trump|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|3for3:  Seamon might have had Axx of clubs, and a 20 count, what is she supposed to do but double?|pg||
nt|joest:  if west had a better trump holding, west should try a third round of hearts for a trump promotion but as it is, that doesn't rate too work too well unless partner has something like QJ doubleton|pg||
nt|joest:  and that is worth playing for|pg||
nt|joest:  north almost certainly has six trumps for this auction|pg||
nt|joest:  so west can count six trumps + 3 clubs + 1 diamond from her perspective|pg||
nt|3for3:  not much other hope, is there?|pg||
nt|joest:  agreed|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|joest:  no matter how absurd your contract is you have to forget the bidding and try to make what you're in|pg||
nt|joest:  now because of the lack of a negative double on her right west can probably work out that the four card spade holdindg is at her left|pg||
nt|joest:  therefore hooking the spade ten cannot be right|pg||
nt|joest:  because at best that would pickup Jxx in the pocket and so would not be necessary|pg||

nt|joest:  and now we will see the perils of the 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|3for3:  Easy for Goldberg to imagine bigger thing, imagine K@H is K@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|joest:  the 4-1 trump split could doom 6@s while 6@d still has play|pg||

nt|3for3:  sprung gambles 3nt|pg||
nt|3for3:  742 looks like a stopper|pg||
nt|joest:  3Nt does show the solid suit|pg||
nt|3for3:  and it could be enough, since neither opponent bid spades when they could|pg||
nt|joest:  if they run the spades when you are cold for 5@c, too bad|pg||
nt|joest:  It would not have gone this way had south overcalled 1@s :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  No, I expect Goldberg would be declaring|pg||
nt|joest:  so West has a pretty good hand over there|pg||
nt|joest:  which raises another important question: how wide can the range for a 3NT rebid be?|pg||
nt|joest:  if you can do it on this hand|pg||
nt|joest:  or on this hand + the Ace of spades|pg||
nt|joest:  partner is put to a series of unappealing guesses|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|joest:  I think 4NT is reasonable myself|pg||

nt|joest:  right|pg||
nt|joest:  that is a cold slam|pg||

nt|joest:  a 'miracle layout|pg||
nt|joest:  the bidding is still underway in the other room|pg||
nt|joest:  and it is a weird auction imho|pg||
nt|joest:  east opened a Precision 2@c (long clubs less than 16 HCP)|pg||
nt|joest:  West placed teh contract with 3NT|pg||
nt|joest:  East now bid 4@c|pg||
nt|joest:  :)|pg||
nt|joest:  I suspect we will see Seamon do somethign relatively aggressive|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest:  she knows there are solid clubs at her right|pg||
nt|joest:  a reasonable hand at her left|pg||
nt|joest:  a heart suit at her left|pg||
nt|joest:  and the Jx of hearts is not a good sign|pg||
nt|joest:  so she is going to get aggressive and try to find her partner home with something in spades|pg||
nt|joest:  good news; partner does have something in spades|pg||
nt|joest:  bad news: partner only has one spade|pg||
nt|jmunday:  sprung needs a miracle and its there|pg||
nt|3for3:  the 9@S might be hard to read, but nothing else to play for, is there?|pg||
nt|joest:  well in checking at the other table, west PASSED 4@c|pg||
nt|3for3:  4@C in the other room...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest:  taking it as a sign of weakness, instead of a sign of great strength|pg||
nt|jmunday:  she needs @HJ onside and the hand with heart ace to have only 1 spade; still wil require good timing|pg||
nt|joest:  one reasonable inference: if partners' had was that good why did she not open a strong club?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|3for3:  Dull looking 4@H here|pg||
nt|joest:  although perhaps they play two way in which case they could show a four card raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:	South will almost certainly make a Drury 2@c call?|pg||
nt|joest:  good raise to 2@h|pg||
nt|jmunday:  e/w have green light vulernability but nothing much with which to take advantage of it|pg||
nt|3for3:  I would, ior 2@D if they play that|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jmunday:  i would use some form of drury|pg||
nt|3for3:  too good for a single raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:	if north can probe for @D shortness she might do that|pg||
nt|jmunday:  sokolow will have visions of slam dashed when partner can't offer @D control|pg||
nt|joest:  so now I would think North would just start describing her hand with 3@c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jmunday:  switch south's minors as danny points out and slam is golden|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:	splintering in 3@s is certainly a possibility as well|pg||
nt|3for3:  the 4@C cue will end things|pg||
nt|joest:  perhaps south wll cue bid 4@c, perhaps not|pg||
nt|3for3:  and make the defense faster|pg||
nt|jmunday:  i would, 3@S really improves the hand|pg||
nt|joest:  with no aces or kiings or trick sources outside|pg||
nt|3for3:  no spade wastage|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|jmunday:	its below game and we are a passed hand|pg||
nt|joest:  now 4@h and we're done|pg||
nt|3for3:  x AJxxxx AKx Axx|pg||
nt|3for3:  and that is a laydown slam|pg||
nt|joest:  that is all true.  Of course I wouldn't be splintering it with a stiff ace because it causes partners to misevaluate their hands but that is another story|pg||
mb|4D|nt|joest:  many people like to do it and I won't argue with them|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: excellent point jack|pg||
nt|jmunday:  last train danny?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|3for3:  I wouldnt|pg||
nt|joest:  so last train = "nothing about diamonds but I am still interested"|pg||
nt|3for3:  Now they will get there it seems|pg||
nt|jmunday:  someone needed to put on the breaks|pg||
nt|joest:  you pay a price for this b/c now, unlike standard bidding, south has no inference that they are off a diamond control|pg||
nt|joest:  partner might or might not have one to make this artificial call|pg||
nt|jmunday:  having bid 4@C, surely south has bid the full value of the hand|pg||
nt|3for3:  How does seamon know Sokolow doesnt have my example hand above?|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|joest:  because north would blackwood with that hand after catching a 4@c cue bid|pg||
nt|3for3:  perhaps, jack|pg||
nt|joest:  at least the way I see it :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  6@C?  Isnt she showing a void and odd KC?|pg||
nt|joest:  now I'm guessing but I think this is suggesting 6@c as a place to play but I'm not sure how this could be since her partner's 4@c call was clearly on shortness|pg||
nt|3for3:  Seamon might bid 7@H over that|pg||
nt|joest:  so the translation here is that Im lost.  I apologize|pg||
nt|3for3:  Can I apologize for calling this a dull 4@H now?:)|pg||
nt|joest:  when in doubt retreat to the small slam|pg||
nt|warrens:  LOL|pg||
mb|6D|mb|d|mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jmunday:  that will remove any doubt about a diamond lead, not that it would matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:	Ok, new leader...see you soon :)|pg||
nt|jmunday:  sprung sensing the wheels have come off adds insult to the injury|pg||
nt|joest:  not sure how east knows both diamonds are cashing but hey...|pg||
nt|3for3:  she knows a wheel has come off somewhere, i am sure|pg||
nt|joest:  so this will put the finishing touches on a very good set for the Goldberg team|pg||
pc|d5|nt|joest:  although there were plenty of places that each team could have picked up a few|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest:  so this seems like about 14 imps going over to Goldberg who will head into today's final segment up about 8 or so|pg||
nt|joest:  although I welcome corrections to my arithmetic|pg||
nt|warrens:  She better not stick in the 9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ritong: sprung had a problem for her lead  she envisaged leading the @d >K i guess, then 4@d by declarer sounds like a singleton|pg||
nt|joest:  BTW thanks to you kibitzers for all the various comments and insights|pg||
nt|joest:  cna't reply to all of them b/c often there are just too many but thanks|pg||

mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|shuster:  West seems to have interjected a lead direct here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: you think deas makes delayed 2@S call when NS might not get to game?|pg||
nt|shuster:  they won't be in a big hurry to double you, knowing they have a vul game to bid.|pg||
