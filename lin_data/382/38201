mb|1D|mb|p|nt|KiwiBridge: wow game on!|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: Amazed that 4@H wasn't reached at other table.  Looks like N-S had a mixup.|pg||

nt|panja: @D now?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|KiwiBridge: the fortuitous Quack of @D's|pg||
nt|panja: a trump will stop a @S ruff...a @D....a possible extra discard...|pg||
nt|panja: Declarer does not know @DQJ are coming down...|pg||
nt|panja: he certainly knows @SA is off|pg||
nt|kit: As things are, game doesn't look so good to declarer with ace of spades likely offside|pg||
nt|panja: because of the opening|pg||
nt|kit: his best play is probably to win in hand and play for hearts 2-2 and QJx of diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: Since he can always lead up to king of spades later|pg||
nt|kit: Although if West has stiff heart, going after the ruff is fine|pg||
nt|panja: in that case, would you play @SK after winning @HT, say?|pg||
nt|kit: So maybe best play is to win heart, play AK of diamonds, and if no honor comes down then try spade|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|panja: there is also a chance @SA will come down in three rounds...|pg||
nt|kit: And if diamonds don't work, can try king of spades out of hand|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|kit: I don't think he game this much of a play, but he will be lucky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: another idea could have been to rattle off trumps...to put pressure on W....|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kit: how does ace of spades coming down in 3 matter?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sJ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: y, one club lost early...so @SA would have had to come down in two, not 3|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: at this stage in CR W pitched QJ @D|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer could still go down if he thinks West has Qjx of diamonds and goes for some end-play|pg||
nt|kit: But it is a little far-fetched|pg||
nt|panja: might have worked while the @S was still in Dummy..|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|panja: because a @S ruff was not going to happen after the trump shift anyway|pg||
