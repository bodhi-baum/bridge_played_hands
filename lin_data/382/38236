nt|3for3:  red vs white you should hope to have some chance of your save making.  aiming for -200 vs -420 is a very narrow targer|pg||

nt|marlowepi: true enough, but ppartner will provide the shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  glasson has an interesting hand...2nt or scientific 1@C?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: after RHO has passed, I think 1C gets the nod at these colors|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|3for3:  i like 2nt 3d hand.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  slam is unlikely and you have some tenaces to protect|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you are going to get to rebid NT regardless so no real rush to "rightside"|pg||
nt|3for3:  I prefer 3NT to show a 7th club, and not this many HCP, but that is a matter of style|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be right to start with NT when partner has 5 spades, or 46 majors and dobleton D|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: all good points, but then sometimes partner has 2 small hearts (or 3 with opening leader having five of them), and 5C is trivial while 3N is down|pg||
nt|3for3:  sprung knows that goldberg must have the stuff for her chance to beat 3nt; Diamonds are the best chance, as she might have overcalled 1@S with some stuff there|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: yes, the contra-indication for spades is strong enough that i think one would try hearts before spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|3for3:	2nt opening on 3 gained the swing as Deas in other room, led a club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W will pass 1N for the time being, but after the tranfer is likely to prebalance with 2S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe NS distinguish between 3-cd vs 4-cd superaccept this way|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi kit, just in time ass I haave to go off to a battlefield of my own :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: *as|pg||
nt|3for3:  2@S gives goldberg a convenient chance to get in there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: common professional hazard|pg||
nt|kit: This hand is a good example of why one shouldn't be preaccepting just because one has 4-card support and a maximum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 2s shows 4H and a max, i think something else i cant see also|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: optimal superaccept policy is controversial. Playing MPs there is far less case for it in general I think. risk/reward ratio more favorable at IMPs, but even so many of us  have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: conservative views in that direction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: the risk of getting the 3 of the major down 1 outweighs the possible gain of reaching a thin game which wouldn't have been reached with no super-accept|pg||
