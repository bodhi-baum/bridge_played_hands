mb|4D|nt|odysseus69: 1S showed diamonds- 2C forced 2D - then 2 natural as 3H -dont know about 3S - earlier are guesses|pg||
mb|p|nt|aardv:	i guess south has shown four spades five diamonds without the desire to bash 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|aardv:  well, if you reach slam they'll make it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: tghink North should have bid 3NT over 3S but far from sure - always difficult when system not clear|pg||
