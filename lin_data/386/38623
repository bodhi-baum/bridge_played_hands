nt|aardv:  perhaps East could work this out, but you have to be on good form not to play low in tempo|pg||

nt|aardv:  They may play 4@S on a misunderstanding|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|aardv:  To North it looks as if South is offering a spade contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hardly- they plasy 5 card majors and N orth thinks spades agreed and he has made a cue bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: maybe thats a serious slam try- so 5 level too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzhd: South passes with a shrug|pg||
nt|aardv:  well, by a stroke of good fortune, they've found a game GIB can make|pg||
pc|s2|nt|odysseus69: no way - he thought he was facing a much stronger hand and was making a cue bid |pg||
nt|aardv:  one making line is to draw trumps, cash the diamonds, ruff one, lead a club to the king, ruff another diamond, and exit in hearts |pg||
nt|aardv:  it's not at all obvious to play that way|pg||
