nt|odysseus69: perhaps spade 9 at trick 4 and smooth duck from West|pg||
nt|aardv:  however, there is a snag|pg||
nt|aardv:  pointed out by an alert kibbitzer|pg||
nt|aardv:  West may duck the spade finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: bioard 29 could be slam swing if they bid 6D -not impossible- they need p;oints and know it|pg||
nt|aardv:  declarer may not repeat the finesse however - probably shouldn't against expert opponents|pg||

pc|dK|pc|sJ|nt|aardv:  declarer is going to ruff a diamond high and claim as soon as West plays a card|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the question of stamina is interesting - for some 64 boards is exhausting - for others its a walk in the park|pg||
mc|12|nt|aardv:  i'll switch tables.  thanks and goodbye|pg||
