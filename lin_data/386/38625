mb|4H|nt|aardv:  2@S pass or correct I suppose, but potentially long spades|pg||
nt|aardv:  usually 2@S shows a liking for hearts, but West should be aware that occasionally it will be spades, knowing (or very nearly so) that West has hearts|pg||

nt|aardv:  so he will make it|pg||
nt|vugraphzhd: TD called for a misexplanation|pg||
mc|10|nt|aardv:  declarer also makes by playing a diamond at the end - the diamonds are very favourable too|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i have been expecting the TD- however difficult to see how whatever the wrong explanations were- how they damaged n/s - however somehow rulings always go against wthe people who ...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: give wrong explanations -|pg||
nt|aardv:  i dare say N-S have give some wrong explanations today too.	But that's allowed if you get to a contract which fails.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: even with club king and a club -contract still a make|pg||
nt|aardv:  North may argue that he would have led clubs against a different explanation, which would have given declarer a different problem|pg||
nt|aardv:  but it does look as if it's normal to make with both minors so favourable|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|aardv:  you can see three tricks, so either the hearts run or partner has to have a minor suit trick, and if the latter setting up one more heart trick is sufficient.  and if you want just one more heart trick, a small one is best|pg||

nt|aardv:  declarer will be pretty sure about the diamond position, but he still needs to generate a ninth trick|pg||
