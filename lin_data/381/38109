nt|mike_G: and from now on we will have comparisons|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1H|mb|d!|nt|uni_dennis: DBL = 4/5 |pg||
nt|thetaker: Aggressive Double by South|pg||
nt|mike_G: as soon as East overcalls there is no chance West will stop below 4@H|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4/5 @s |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: south can expect a big @h raise from West|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so either enter now or not enter at all|pg||
nt|mike_G: only risk is that they get overboard now, but it looks like 5@H can also make on a spade guess|pg||

mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|mike_G: as NS bids a lot West knows that partner has a light overcall and settles for game|pg||

nt|vugraphzef: west and south explaing the bidding|pg||

nt|nilsland:  4@C can be made I think if you play for N to have 3 diamonds and 1 club|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|3C!|nt|thetaker: She knows @SA is with North as well, since South would have cashed it, if he had it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mike_G: You play on hearts and North has to ruff|pg||
