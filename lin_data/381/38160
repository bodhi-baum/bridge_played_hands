nt|grebrof: Norway might win some imps back here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|sommer:  11 imps for bidding slam|pg||
mb|3H!|an|cue|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  certainly an opportunity|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont understand the bidding at the other table, but conventions and system developement have always been more adventurous in Sweden than in Norway|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mdgraham:  if East's sequence is FG with diamond support, the West hand is huge, with all those controls|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|5H!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  5H likely D!Q-ask|pg||

nt|mdgraham:  5nt=yes, but no outside kings|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  which will not be any surprise to West|pg||
nt|grebrof: Ax of @cs is nice of cours - can he kick back with 6@c?|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  mind you, if E had one heart less and one club more, 7D would not be good |pg||
nt|grebrof: W doesnt know that E only has 3 trumps|pg||
mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  6C asking for third-round control, if they have that in their arsenal |pg||
nt|grebrof: will he bid the grand with only 3 trumps?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sommer:  they will be surpriced, that missing the grand only costs 3 imp!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:	is 7 that good? Awkward on 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|grebrof: I dont think missing the grand is bad bridge|pg||
nt|sommer:  no!|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  as ever, possession of a ninth trump would make a big difference|pg||
nt|grebrof: you survive the the 5-0 split if you can discard on the A of @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: north is just asking to the bidding before his lead|pg||
