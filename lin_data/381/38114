nt|vugraphzef: south is still in the tank |pg||
nt|nilsland:  perhaps N should have X 3S having denied 4S|pg||

nt|nilsland:  then 3N is still in the picture|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but unlikely|pg||
nt|mike_G: Playing relays their methods are absolutely fine even if this bid isn't the strength of the system|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  A system with an artificial 1@c and 1@d may have its limitations|pg||

nt|mike_G: If we switch the red aces (or kings) it's making, funny game bridge|pg||
nt|mike_G: I think they could've set it 800 on two rounds of hearts to South and then three rounds of diamonds ruffed with the @CK|pg||

nt|nilsland:  very odd defense :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|thetaker: North expects South to have at least 3 @D|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|thetaker: Because of the double|pg||
nt|mike_G: last chance to cash the hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  If North passes, he must decide which major to lead. (@SQ at the other table)|pg||
mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  And the players themselves have a wonderful time at this event, the pictures are amazing!|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|mike_G: Same bidding here, impressive|pg||
nt|nilsland:  same lead other table|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  3@c suffers from a weak suit, and from 6-3-2-2, not to mention an outside King|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: we hope to welcome you all back next year |pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North played @DA instead of @HQ, later at the other table.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|nilsland:  normally you dont want to ruff with trump length, but here may be a case for 1 ruff and then an uppercut|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  South had discarded perhaps confusing @H7.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|nilsland:  so the lead is not as bad as it looks|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Thanks all from the USA, wouldn't miss this fine event!|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: west is taking his time |pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Both Souths did well to find the double. (I would not have been up to it... obviously too old.)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  S h in other room was problable because he was "sure" had 3 diam after the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: lol David|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but itt was |pg||
nt|nilsland:  no hurry|pg||
