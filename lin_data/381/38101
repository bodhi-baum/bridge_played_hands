nt|vugraphzfy: closed room 2@H by South|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: south might bid 3@d over 2@h though|pg||

nt|mike_G: I think that's too aggressive white on red|pg||
nt|ritong: i don t advocate bidding 3@d, but since i predicted they will not bid @ds at all i offer a chance:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: 2N pass 5@D?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mike_G: If you play Gazilli and South thinks the hand is worth a 2@C rebid you might find 5@D at least|pg||

nt|vugraphzfy: South annoyed now|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: South asking about signal at trick 1, attitude on Ace leads, and when they give count low=even|pg||
nt|mike_G: it's actually really important that East kept the beer card as that's what's stopping the squeeze against West|pg||
nt|mike_G: But they could also have killed that threat with three rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: and it looked like the natural neutral defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: hmm East played @D7 at the 2nd trick :(|pg||
nt|mike_G: Oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: sry|pg||
nt|nilsland:  then there is a squeeze|pg||

nt|Authau: welcome to Mikael, brother's Ida (West)|pg||
nt|mike_G: West had a choice between 1NT and doubling the first time|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|mike_G: I guess most would prefer double with only a single stopper in hearts and that would have worked better as East can then compete in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: I think East was close to competing anyway|pg||
nt|mike_G: Yes, protecting over 2@D was absolutely plausible|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: we start with board 13&14 here so we have results from the close room later on|pg||
nt|mike_G: But with length in hearts it is very likely that the defense will score some heart ruffs|pg||
nt|mike_G: So it wasn't obvious|pg||
nt|vugraphzfy: North took a pause over 2@D p. so he was thinking about raising or bidding 2@H you both like that with East|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mike_G: The pause points towards he's actual shape (as East has some cards himself) and you don't want to get them out of a 4-3 fit|pg||

nt|mike_G: But with 6-4 :)|pg||

nt|Authau: had he showed 0/7 hcp ?  he had|pg||
nt|vugraphzfz: expecting no 4@s opposite|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: if he has doubt, he can simply double 2@d to show max of his range, what he has actually|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  East might be able to calculate that his partner could not hold too many diamonds, nor hearts, and so was virtually certain to hold four spades. 2@S was indicated.|pg||
