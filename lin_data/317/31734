nt|panosk:  and has nothing better to turn to|pg||
nt|patricck: West wouldn't have been on lead|pg||
nt|panosk:  ah yes forgot about that|pg||
nt|patricck: hard for east to continue when declarer might have Jxx or Jxxx|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: what?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|patricck: that gave away the contract|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East played @C7 at trick one|pg||
nt|patricck: now declarer loses 1 trump, 1 club and 1 diamond and there are entries to dummy in the spade suit|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: say two rounds of clubs instea - South ruffs, spade to king and ace...East now has to play a heart, and with KJx woiulod exit with the jack or king|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|roswolf:  some kind of weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf:  2nt rebid is a bit stultifying|pg||
nt|vugraphzcv: this is Seniors, so no Two opening from E. Seniors are too nice (or so I'm told)|pg||
nt|roswolf:  not brian senior this is a standard opening for him|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|roswolf:  even in acol what is wrong with cue bidding?|pg||

nt|panosk:  yes very good, only needs to bid it|pg||
nt|patricck: makes on a 3-2 heart break or the K@C onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: i can only imagine that the time of morning had something to do with it - it is early to be playing brtidge|pg||
nt|panosk:  not even the @C finess|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk:  5@H and 6@D and 2 A|pg||
nt|patricck: need the @C finesse if @H are 4-1|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|panosk:  yes|pg||
nt|patricck: so makes if hearts 3-2 or if hearts 4-1 with K@C onside|pg||
nt|patricck: about 81%|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect a lot of (particularly Polish) players would be there with 2@S as East |pg||
nt|patricck: I am farily aggressive at this vulnerability, but not quite good enough for me|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: any thoughts about 4@S from N now being Exclusion? |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk:  I prefer 2@D over 3@S splinter but now N has a problem|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|patricck: A 2@S opening would work well on this hand....   I am just not quite aggressive enough to bid it|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S should be EKCB|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: A spec comments that anyone with the surname Senior would be likely to open 2@s too |pg||
nt|patricck: Exclusion Key Card Blackwood....  asks for Aces and King of Trumps, but asks not to count A@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the downside of 4@s, though, is that it commits you to 5@H opposite what might be three low clubs |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although that would be a tad unlucky|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about this 4@H bid|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|panosk:  there is a view that splinter is not very helpull in finding slams and it should be replaced by a good side suit and fit, here it would worked very well|pg||
nt|patricck: hard to avoid sequences that could be unlucky sometimes|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|mdgraham: what's trumps here?|pg||
nt|patricck: we will see how your theory goes here Panos. South knows about the @D side suit. Let us see if he can bid 7@H|pg||
nt|panosk:  i dont like exclusion if our side is not sure that has slam chances, asking aces should be about confirmation, not suggestion |pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|panosk:  and nowadays we tend to open with a mere 11 count, so N cant be sure yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: indeed - here we can see that Exclusion works superbly, which probably affects our thinking somewhat|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: not suggesting 4@S over 1@H.....thought we were talking about 4@S over 2NT. What else would that be?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panosk:  and S has a 3NT rebid i think not 2NT, right?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ruff a spade in dummy and you odn't even need the club finesse, on semi-normal breaks|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, that is true....my analysis of 81% for the Grand Slam is underestimating|pg||
