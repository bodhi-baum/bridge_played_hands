nt|thegarve: On hands like this in 4@h, you play on the side suits to discover a few clues of point count |pg||
nt|roswolf:  hmm unexpected auction surely nt not a real option here|pg||
nt|thegarve: Its wise to play transfers in 1M-1Nt-2NT auctions|pg||
nt|roswolf:  1nt probably forcing|pg||
nt|thegarve: so that you can transfer to @h and then bid 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|thegarve: so 3@s would be a @c suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  obviously was forcing to describe the hand shape|pg||
nt|thegarve: and of course the strong balanced hand plays the contract from the short side|pg||

nt|roswolf:  declarer unlikely to get this right|pg||

nt|roswolf:  2@c looks strange|pg||
mb|2D|nt|thegarve: well, its a bit heavy for 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf:  maybe of the benjaminised type|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|thegarve: if you play 2@h opposite as a double negaive (0-3) you could play there|pg||
nt|roswolf:  where 2@c shows inter alia an 8 playing trick hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|thegarve: a routine slam for some|pg||

nt|roswolf:  maybe 2@c was indeed acol|pg||
nt|thegarve: and will get a @s lead to create the extra entry and make 13 tricks|pg||

nt|roswolf:  east going to lie!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thegarve: Hmmm|pg||

nt|roswolf:  brave at these colors|pg||

mb|5D|nt|thegarve: Hmm that must be smacked|pg||
