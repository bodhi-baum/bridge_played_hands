nt|timb: yes it would be. I'm coming to Melbourne next month, on the 12th of October and heading back to Canberra on either 15th or the 16th|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Fantoni must bid 5@D here, he does not know about the solid @D or if Nunes has 2 or 3 keycards.|pg||
nt|granguru:  7@D as a @H finesse permits to discard a @S |pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: However Nunes will keep bidding to confirm all keycards + Q@D|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chmitty: ater you ruff 2 @h you also have a chance for a squeeze against a West who would hold K@h + Qxx@s|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Might be a possible squeeze out there on a different lie, but he does'nt need it here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kamil's early @S bid made it easy to avoid 7@S  but maybe also eliminated chance of finding 7N|pg||
nt|granguru:  there is still a show up squeeze if heart k is with west|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that should be IF rather than if|pg||

mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: all cues,|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: now 4N even   of keycards|pg||
nt|chmitty: many went down in 6@h after a @s lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: played @h from the top to avoid a @s ruff|pg||
nt|chmitty: 6NT by South would be perfect|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And of course a club lead would kill 6@H stone dead|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: They should be in @hs now and not @S, |pg||
nt|chmitty: too late now|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Jay -- if 3@H supposed to be 4+ fit, what was the convention rebid for Nunes?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 5N = 3 keycards without Q@H|pg||
nt|chmitty: 6@h was usually played by South after a 1NT opening and transfer|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Nunes was suppose to rebid 2N|pg||
nt|chmitty: thus the @s lead|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: They are all discussing something|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Nunes just pointed at himself, maybe he knows he forgot|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 1@S 2@H 2N = 3@H, 1@S 2@H 3@H = 4@H|pg||
