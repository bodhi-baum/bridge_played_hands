mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|mrdct:  2NT might be leb here|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  I think it's minors|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  Can I recommend people don't play Lebensohl "by default" ... limit it to a few very specific auctions|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bjacobs:  Much more useful is to use 2NT as some sort of scrambling bid, like here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|mrdct:  traian chira, the WBF vugraph coordinator, is God|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  and the standard of the vugraph operators has been first class in this tournament|pg||
nt|mrdct:  many of whom i recognise as players coming out of GABSI's youth programme|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Interesting auction: South doesn't like 3NT because of the diamond problem (North's marked shortage)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So maybe a 7-card major suit fit, but which one?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:	thanks also to Bill and to all of the specs for their kind commments|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  Very delicate, and I love H-H's judgment on this deal|pg||
