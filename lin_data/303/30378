nt|BridgeGoth: If anyone has ever kibitzed Fantoni in person, they'll know that we might be here a while :)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Hi and welcome|pg||
nt|chmitty: To sum 11 tricks, you need 4@c from hand, 2 ruffs, 2 spades and therefore 3@d|pg||
nt|chmitty: but i until now can't see how you can manage that|pg||
nt|chmitty: or alternatively develop 3 @s tricks ?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: He can get a 4th@D i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: @s continuation would be great for defense now.|pg||
nt|chmitty: for communications reasons, I believe the only way was to play ... @dQ from dummy at trick 2|pg||
nt|chmitty: impossible in practice of course|pg||
nt|chmitty: but defence is not easy either|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: @S would be a killer because it would remove the entry to dummy. He won't have time to establish the last @D|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: He has to ruff a @D now, and the overruff will not hurt since it is with the long trump.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Results: http://www.worldbridge.org/repository/tourn/bali.13/microsite/Results.htm|pg||
nt|chmitty: Fantoni can't afford to play 2 rounds of trump because he would kill a vital entry to dummy|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: He neeeds to establish @D first.|pg||
nt|chmitty: @d now is a must : the 9 to discard a @s from his hand (and later on guess the spade situation) or small @d ruffed|pg||
nt|chmitty: all that because when East ruffs he can't play @h becauyse of the threat to establish the J@h (or 9@h) from hand|pg||
nt|chmitty: very complicated layout|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: if he ruffs, Fantoni has 11 tricks doesn't he?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: K@S then has a ruffing finesse has well once the other @S id discarded|pg||
nt|vugraphzcb: N still think..|pg||
nt|chmitty: if he plays small @d ruffed and overruffed, East has no good move|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Canada is off to a fast start and currently sits 8th, Japan now in 9th.|pg||
nt|chmitty: play @s or trumps give time to establish the @s|pg||
nt|chmitty: and play top @h allows to later on play the Jack from hand (see 10x in West's hand)|pg||
nt|chmitty: now that we see that playing small @d riffed is OK, that does not mean Fantoni is going to play like that|pg||
nt|chmitty: @d could be 33 for instance|pg||
nt|ritong: that would leave three black cards to east|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Well 5@C failed in the other room, so Monaco has a chance for a huge gain|pg||
nt|ritong: thus a near certitude to get it right about @ss|pg||
nt|nickf: y|pg||
