mb|3N|nt|kareno: While Monaco are very well placed, England is on the cusp for survival to the KO rounds and must improve their position.  So this is a very important match for them|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Anyone who has questions please feel free to ask me privately|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: There are results|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Hi Bill. Hi Karen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|BridgeGoth: Nunes there is a Slavinsky lead:|pg||
nt|kareno: Bill :)  Jay:)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Low = Odd with honor or even without honor, High = odd without honor or even with honor|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  What was going on in this auction?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Essentially he has led from either: Hxx Hxxxx or xxxx|pg||
nt|kareno: Sounds to me like puppet Stayman. but they lost the heart suit if that was the case.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: E/w play udca with reverse smith, and will also do these funny leads midhand|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well, it's fairly embarrassing|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: If he can guess the @H he can still make it, but thats a big if|pg||
nt|kareno: It well could be that this goes down but the same guess is there in a heart contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  very big if, because there won't be a lot of evidence to lead him to making a non-standard play in the suit|pg||
nt|kareno: If it was puppet, souch could have bid spades to show hearts.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|BridgeGoth: the @D discard would be very useful in a @H contract, |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And no holdup play is going to work in spades, because then the defenders will just play on clubs|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Fantoni's 2@D says he wants Nunes to continue @S|pg||
nt|kareno: He may make the winning play in hearts as a safety play against the danger hand|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Will be no safety play if a @C switch|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|pitiful1:	good morning|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  That's a good point Karen, because declarer may be aware that spades are 5-2|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  i should be able to help with n-s system|pg||
nt|kareno: Peter :)  Almost morning here in Vegas|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: The lead marks them for 5-2, the 2@S would be Qxxx2|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kareno: Safe play in hearts needed and if spades are known 5-2 it's clear to take it|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  North has shown a maximum suitable for NT|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: From Nunes' spot card it is 100% 5-2 unless Fantoni has QJT tight|pg||
nt|vugraphzby: N is thinking|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Bill is this a reason you don't play Slavinsky anymore?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Not really - I just found them too hard to process with my aging brain|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Tried for about a year ...|pg||
nt|kareno: I would also, frankly|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: They are very informative to Fantunes, but can also help the opponents|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I suspect against MOST opponents, they won't be able to process it, so that gives F-N the advantage|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|bjacobs:  Here you can almost see the cogs ticking over in Robson's brain|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, Andy Robson isn't MOST opponents.|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: What was that?|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: Having played their leads a lot, they would not affect me, but to someone who has not seen them before, they can be daunting to figure out. Thus the advantage.|pg||
nt|kareno: No and really they can't afford to do poorly in this match|pg||
nt|kareno: Or any other at this point.|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Agree Jay ... Slavinsky leads are hard work|pg||
mb|2S|nt|BridgeGoth: 2@S: 10-13 5@S+minor or 6+@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  6 back to England, rather fortuitously|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: this will be a good result for England. Very lucky 3NT in the other room.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pitiful1:  at the other table, 2@h was a transfer rebid, 2N asked for shortage and 3@s denied one and was minimum|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Still it could be argued that both 3@S and 3NT depend on similar luck, so the English contract at the other table might be best|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, excellent result for England.  The first board was costly as predicted|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Here is a case where Fantunes 2s don't work so well, however when their side has a fit, they are really deadly! What do you think Bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I think 3@S is a perfectly reasonable contract, even without the fit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Right, but as we see, the real fit was @C, which they had no way to mention|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Never mentioned in the other room either :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|BridgeGoth: I would think many 2/1 players would respond 3@C to 1@S as natural and invitational, but the e/w pair in the other room did not try this. So @Cs never found there either.|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  Forrester Gold have recently changed their 2M bids to 5M and 4+m 10-13 |pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  OK, if it does go 1@S-3@C invitational, that's a nice auction to a sound partscore|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  they would previously have opened the East hand with a constructive weak 2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|pitiful1:  Allfrey might remove to 2@c now as north has denied 4@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  1NT a bit wrong sided as it happens|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  the 1@s rebid was up to a poor 16|pg||
nt|kareno: mm not really.  Heart lead from east would make 1nt uncomfortable for north|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: Rule of thumb: Whatever i predict is always wrong, so bet against me folks|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  I suppose a spade lead also works, but that really wasn't on the radar on this auction: it was always going to be a red suit|pg||

nt|pitiful1:  Robson hates to pass|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: BridgeGoth would not be happy camper if he was sitting W right now.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Then again, he wouldn't have been as soon as 2@C hit the table.|pg||
nt|kareno: If he can interrupt communications, why should he?|pg||
nt|dburn:  anyone would hate to pass in the middle of a Fantunes relay auction when he could bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs:  They are in a bad position because West hasn't shown a suit|pg||
nt|kareno: Hi David :)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Fantoni can't like this, at the 4 level with possibly no fit and he has'nt named a suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Maybe this is a time for 5NT = pick a slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  hello Karen|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|kareno: I think they can have problems when their relays are broken up - like this.  Is 4@h forcing, Jay?|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  not a good advert for the methods|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 4@H is not forcing|pg||
nt|dburn:  no reason why this should not end the auction|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I don't think it's a good advert for any auction where one player has made an artificial bid, and then got preempted|pg||
nt|kareno: The first question I ask when playing against that sort of system is, 'how high do I have to bid to break up your relays?"|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: The problem is not the interferce persay, the problem is when you have 2 suiters facing a 2 level opening, it never works well.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I'm not 100% sure they find slam without the 3@S bid, though it's much more likely|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  well I think that those methods that could start by west showing a suit rather than relaying might have a better chance|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: West cannot making a natural forcing bid over 2@C|pg||
nt|granguru:  I think W should have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  On this deal, certainly, on the other 90% of deals, certainly not|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, if the methods would not find a slam given a free run, the methods should be towed out to sea and sunk by gunfire|pg||
nt|kareno: Gold and Forrest had a good practical auction to slam|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  as i said a bad hand for the methods|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Am I detecting some delight in some of the comments?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Nunes would show @S before @D and Fantoni would make a forcing @H bid, @D may get lost.|pg||
nt|pitiful1:  no|pg||
nt|kareno: A spec tells me 4@h is forcing.|pg||
nt|dburn:  Nunes may be thinking that double then 4@h actually shows two suits|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  yeah well ...|pg||
nt|dburn:  rather than just a good 4@h bid|pg||
nt|dburn:  certainly he is thinking about something - even Robson isn't passing slowly as North|pg||
nt|kareno: No doubt it is east who is thinking.  The bids should be relayed in pairs, and north and east are on the same side of the screen|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: actually any (reasonable) slam he may bid makes|pg||
nt|kareno: If in fact 4@h is not forcing, east well may pass.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: from his side, 12 tops in NT also|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  Nunes isn't going to bid a slam - he's going to pass or he's going to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  and now he's not going to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: So Robson has scored a vulnerable slam swing for his side.|pg||
