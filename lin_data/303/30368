nt|jkdood: Kranyak can play low and make it, or play the Q, and also make it|pg||
nt|casenjo:  with 9+ cards in partner's majors - he jus 'might' have had a diamond void and you get a nice little cross ruff on defense|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I don't see how the heart lead can beat it -I'm with you King of @D glaring lead|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes, as specs suggest, A and a heart later makes, so all leads allow 6C to make|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6C on 24 high is always a nice result|pg||
nt|casenjo:  That's looking at all hands, but I want to make the lead that I think will beat the contract|pg||
nt|casenjo:  with partner having the majors, and i have diamonds, I cannot vision my tricks going away|pg||
nt|jkdood: Im suspect Kaku feels his partner would double 4D with an ace or void, so why not try something else|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I would always bid 3@C vulnerable or not against that 2@H opener|pg||
nt|jkdood: He is lucky this lead (away from K) did not cost the contract, which is always cold all leads|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Remember 2@H may be as few as 3 High Card Points|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6@D would be a well-paying sacrifice eh?|pg||
nt|casenjo:  So you must overcall any 7 card suit|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Diamond lead holds them to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|casenjo:  or diamond shift|pg||
nt|jkdood: Japan gets on the board with 13 imps, Levin Weinstein bid to 6C on hand both minors broke so bad|pg||
nt|jkdood: As 6@C is spiffy to bid and 6@D sac pays well NV, USA may get some back here|pg||
nt|casenjo:  6@D goes for 800|pg||
nt|casenjo:  lose 2 hearts, 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|jkdood: It would be tempting to lead A@S versus 6D, may not do as well|pg||
nt|jkdood: But even 800 is good versus 1370 for 6@C :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Levin-Weinstein play 11-15 Flannery, so the auction will surely be different|pg||
nt|jkdood: Flannery is 5H and 4S|pg||
