mb|2C|nt|barnets: i like it as a strong nt|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly - and it's a question of when it's weak...|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: me too -- but I think they are playing weak NT|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I am told 14-16 3/4 seat|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: 2@D asks for better major|pg||
nt|kareno: So the split is on the vulnerability and the seat|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kit: There may be some ambiguity about this double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Since if West wanted to play a major, he could just bid 3@H now|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|kit: Of course defending 3@D doubled wouldn't have been so bad for E-W|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess it is an offer to defend but with major suit lengths|pg||
nt|kit: ie one of those "do something intelligent" doubles, when partner never passes in real life.|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably shed a club on the third round of diamonds, but he still has to deal with potential 2 heart losers.|pg||
nt|barnets: so Canada won 4 imps on board 2 where n/s only got 500 from 2@SX|pg||
nt|kit: He can do it via ducking a heart, then taking 2 trumps, then hearts -- this faile only when North is 3-2-6-2.|pg||

nt|ritong: chip torured three boards in a row|pg||

mb|p|pc|d7|nt|barnets: east can get a diamond ruff by reaching partner with a club but then is endplayed after getting it|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, now he has choices to defeat this|pg||
nt|barnets: they both work|pg||
