mb|5D|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: is North's Pass a Forcing Pass, suggesting keenness to play in slam due to spade void - no it is not. |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|petergill: Poor score for NS, who should have had a way for South to tell if North had 2 or 3 hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: at 5 level or higher, where cash-out is often necessary, playing that a certain honour lead (either ace elad or king lead) asks for count at 5+ level is a good idea.|pg||
nt|petergill: Even I, who is a firm believer in giving attitude signal on honour leads, play that at 5+ level or against 4M opener or overcall, king asks for count|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|petergill: the problem with 3@C was that having 3 card major holdings on the side made it dangerous that you are preempting your own side out of a major contract|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@D cue with @H support|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@s was two-way, either stopper ask of if 3NT removed, then good 4@H raise|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|petergill: 4@D shows A or K in @D (or shortage in @D) and denies A or K in clubs, cue bid|pg||

nt|petergill: correctly |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 5@d is a very dangerous cue bid |pg||
nt|petergill: Very dangerous because some Norths might pass 5@D|pg||
