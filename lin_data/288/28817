mc|7|nt|petergill: Minus 100 might be OK for NS, with EW able to make a partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: The 1NT opening preempted EW out of 3@D|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm not saying that 1NT was a great bid, but if you are a great card player, you have to take that into account in your bidding at matchpt pairs|pg||
nt|petergill: and your partner also should take into account your great card play|pg||
nt|petergill: At matchpts, East should have doubled, or perhaps bid 3@D, over 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Even though this vulnerability is not good for competing, selling out to the 2 level at matchpts is generally not a good idea|pg||
nt|petergill: That was the mantra of Australia's Number One master point holder Bobby Richman, whose funeral I went to today. |pg||
nt|petergill: always try to push the opponents to the 3 level, especially at matchpts|pg||
nt|petergill: One of the other pairs on BBO, perhaps the Brogelands if the names are correct, doubled 2@S for 200|pg||
