mb|p|nt|bt:  given you have no rebid problem after 1@D I would say no|pg||
nt|ritong: it appears that our friend peter has a strong opinion  how surprising|pg||
nt|bt:	but everyone counts points now|pg||
nt|bjurn:  there was a lot of aschewed NT-openings yday|pg||
nt|pelu:  why open 1Nt when u have a normal bid: 1@d follow by 1@s?|pg||
nt|ritong: when opponents pass along, yes|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|bjurn:  and when p doesnt bid 1NT|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bt:  and when he does, you pass?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  then pass (or 2@d) - opening 1Nt almost empty in 2 suits = u lose a lot of money in Rubber :)|pg||
nt|bjurn:  not sure if it would be better playing 1NT or 2@d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bt:  we can assume that the lead would have been different after 1@D anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Why Zaleski used Stayman I don't know|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h9|nt|bjurn:  @d lead wasnt a good start for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 1NT 2NT would not be natural|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h5|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzba: but he bid 3NT...|pg||
nt|bt:	8 tricks and where is the 9th? black endplay maybe?|pg||
nt|ritong: he changed his mind, or he looked for 5@h with opener  both are not really recommendable|pg||
nt|bjurn:  N will have to duck first @h|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bt:	north has a pretty easy low heart shift|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|bt:	north should know south has 9xxx in hearts|pg||
nt|bt:	and needs club king and SQ to beat it|pg||
nt|bjurn:  even if W has @hQxx it's right|pg||
nt|bt:	or spade ace maybe|pg||
nt|pelu:  N know that W = 4-2-5-2|pg||
nt|bt:	9 then lowest in hearts is presumably 9xxx|pg||
nt|bt:	or a club card|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: South's carding is correct from 954 also|pg||
nt|bt:	if that is what they do|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: but then he wouldn't pitch two of them, right?|pg||
nt|bt:	yea and west would be 4351|pg||
nt|pelu:  thye bidding: W = 4 card ! and N know 5 card @D, so noit the signal but simple count|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: that is also true|pg||
nt|bt:	there is a danger of a black suit squeeze if west plays hearts back (as a kind spec noted)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|nt|pelu:  defense = try to create a picture af declares hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bt:	a heart now is enough to make it, given the club discards|pg||
nt|bjurn:  well, NS did well defending 3NT when the lead was unlucky|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bt:	nicely done|pg||
nt|bt:	a good effort by ew to win some imps|pg||
nt|bjurn:  NS only chance is to bare the @CK early on two @H rounds|pg||
nt|pelu:  S sh know to discrd a @s (not a @c) if W has @sJ then 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bt:	and a success for opening 1NT obviously ;)|pg||
nt|bt:	i think there is a steeping stone if south keeps one more club|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu:	blind chicken also sometimes find gold :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|bt:  now he can endplay or finess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: A one-two punch from Manno-Zaleski with a non-standard 1NT-opening and a non-standard 2@C Stayman|pg||
nt|bt:	in some countries there would be a director call after the 2@C unalerted with no major|pg||
nt|bjurn:  maybe the @s2 would have been a more delicate choice?|pg||
nt|pelu:  why Lars - if u play 2@s and 2Nt = transfers to minor, u need to bid 2@c with no major - and opp free to ask|pg||
nt|bt:	it is an alert in some places, just saying|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Swedish rules are to alert 2@C even if it's normal Stayman so I guess North doesn't really have a case|pg||
nt|pelu:  where?|pg||
nt|bt:	i think it used to be in the us, maybe they changed that, there was a famous ruling|pg||
nt|bt:	with sontag involved|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Before the new rules here we had to alert that as well|pg||
nt|bjurn:  well the situation doesnt seem to be obvious for Manno, maybe something can happen here|pg||
nt|bt:	i dont think there is a case in any country|pg||
nt|bt:	anyway, i will be back in 5 minutes, see you soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: A kib says it's the same in the Netherlands but no, there is no risk of a ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Not that I think of at least|pg||
nt|pelu:  but a strange bid by East - u normal only bid 2@C with no major if u have a hand to bid 2Nt (invite)|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ritong: the @sQx clinched it i guess|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  do u agree?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that s why he has a close decision  his hand is in between|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: yes, Peter. That's why some Swedes play 3NT as a suggestion with 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: they play 14-16 NT so he has a maximum|pg||
nt|bjurn:  but what to lead from W? @CK?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: perhaps they play strong K, so rather @cQ|pg||
nt|ritong: they do|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: nine tricks are there for the taking|pg||
nt|ritong: strong K means pard has to unblock any honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: That's how they play|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|bjurn:  with 15 HCP W knows partner has next to nothing so finding p with a fivecard suit is only helpful when NS cant hold off the ace|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: that s agood point, however no other lead is attractive|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: so, he tries for the miracle|pg||
nt|bjurn:  I was thinking about @DQ, if p has the jack it could work as an aggressive lead as well as a deceptive one|pg||
nt|ritong: that a bit advanced for me:) but i get the drift|pg||
nt|bt:	the diamond lead would have surpised declarer, and wouldnt cost anything|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: no problem at all  we all can see that zaleski has an ultraconservative style|pg||
nt|bjurn:  N should have a way to show a good raise, 3@s seems to be more preemptive to me tho|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|bt:	sincerely, i do not understand 3@S either, and when bjÃ¶rn and me agree, dark forces are gathered|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|pelu:  need a perfect defense now, after 2x@c then @hJ and duck from W|pg||
nt|bt:	i would bid that as well bjÃ¶rn|pg||

nt|vugraphzba: If 3@S makes I would be glad that opening 1@C worked badly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|bt:  "Vi i femman" is a pun, playing on there being 5 players in the team (femman) and a name of a famous swedish TV Show|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bt:  he is current swedish team champion and european junior champion|pg||
