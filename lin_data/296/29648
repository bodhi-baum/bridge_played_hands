nt|vugraphzba: even if this for some reason goes down now I can't really figure out how Breno can gain 6 imps on 32|pg||
nt|bg: 4 S made on 31|pg||
nt|runnerup:  he wanted @s -prtner didn't know --ok -mistake|pg||
nt|fluff:  has to play east for @C ace or dec has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 50-1 so far in this set. Never give up.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  surely some miscounting -wd Femman |pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW in this room ran out of steam at the half-way point.|pg||
nt|Psyck: on the bidding E is sure to have at least 1 ace which meant dec had to play E for single @s, which is why I think playing @h from top better than @ht fin|pg||
nt|bg: hope there is a bar close by for Breno team to dicuss these hands:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or not to discuss them.|pg||
nt|fluff:  and lots of beer to forget :)|pg||
