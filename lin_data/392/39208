nt|vugraphzch: Huang   thinking   everyone  aware   something  is    up   |pg||
nt|krhorneman:  in this case, South has both, so either exit is safe, and declarer will have to figure out the heart suit|pg||
nt|krhorneman:  I think on the actual layout, a spade exit will give declarer the hardest time|pg||
nt|krhorneman:  a club exit will be relatively dangerous and might help declarer work out that North thinks a heart exit dangerous too|pg||
nt|vugraphzch:    yes  but  cashing   2nd  spade   brings  a bit  of  pressure  on   north   |pg||

nt|krhorneman:  yes, North does not know West has only three @cs and with only three tricks in for the defense, a @c discard could be deadly, but I think North will know a heart is worse|pg||
