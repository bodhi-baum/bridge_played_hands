mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|gracelin: Kang's line was good after 2-round of clubs.  He needs to return to hand with a club ruff if he chose to ruff two D. So trying to establish club was also good.|pg||
nt|twcho: believe that redouble force partner to bid 2@c|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gracelin: indeed, 2H after that showed 5-card|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|twcho: double is penalty vs weak NT|pg||
nt|twcho: 13-15 generally regarded as weak NT range|pg||

nt|gracelin: showing power.  Seems north cannot double 2H as T/O, as many play.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|twcho: yes, T/O is probably a better usage than penalty|pg||
