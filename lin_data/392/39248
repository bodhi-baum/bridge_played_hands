nt|glen: 4@H looks normal and has no play|pg||
nt|shuster:  lots of wastage in clubs - impossible to diagnose|pg||
nt|jonottawa: if you're going to avoid 4@h bidding 2@h with E is a good start|pg||
nt|shuster:  in fact, even 3@H is too high|pg||
mb|4H|nt|shuster:  when partner raises your 7-card major - bid game.  Now maybe Nic will sniff out a double|pg||

nt|glen: for some reason, the vugraph operators do not prefer this|pg||
nt|jonottawa: might they even take a piece of 5@d? this hand got very interesting allofasudden|pg||
nt|shuster:  E/W have 14 HCP in the minors, along with a singleton in a hand with three trump - and all of that adds up to TWO tricks.	|pg||

mb|2D|an|Multi|nt|glen: I suspect their might have been commentary on the 2@H bid made at the other table|pg||
nt|shuster:  E/W played in 2@H doubled in the closed room, with Pollack passing as dealer, then calling 2@H in the opponents strong auction on the second round.  This went for 800.  A medium loss if 3NT is making|pg||
nt|shuster:  A disaster if it fails|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: in most multi defenses, X by either N or S now is takeout oriented|pg||
