nt|sybarra: not sure even system notes running 300 pages cover hands like these |pg||
nt|nilsland:  interresting with all this alerts, even more if we knew the meaning!|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  I think they use 2@D to distinguish betweem good and bad 6-card-major-hands|pg||

nt|nilsland:  but then again how does he get back to the hand?|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Hearts could be 5-1 too, so there is something to contemplate|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think @SQ is best, hoping for @D 4-3 if spades are 6-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: He is probably thinking about south x|pg||
nt|sybarra: wish we knew for sure what 2 @D was, but I still think it is a "multi-type" bid,  long one major |pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Souths doubling would suggest that 1NT was for the minors (Not an unusual agreement)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  sry @D can not even be 4-3!!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  4-4 is possible thou|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  They can be 4-4 :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzee: scores after round 4 of 6: OPEN TEAMS http://bridge.dk/0009/Klub13/Turneringer/KampResultat1621.html|pg||
pc|c3|nt|adriaantje: south should know by his partner's distributional signals that he cannot take @HA|pg||
nt|adriaantje: and indeed he does not|pg||
nt|adriaantje: good to play on @C now|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: North is thinking|pg||
nt|adriaantje: can still be down 1|pg||
nt|adriaantje: just take @CQ or K and develop your spades|pg||
nt|adriaantje: declarer will only have 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: Yesterday these two teams did play a 20-boards match|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: Denmark winning that one 51-25|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: so Netherlands might get their "revenge" today|pg||
nt|adriaantje: but that's seeing 52 cards of course|pg||
nt|adriaantje: we might hope so :)|pg||

pc|h8|nt|adriaantje: north was probably hoping for his partner to hold @CJ and be able to play @S through declarer|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|nt|adriaantje: but he'll not be feeling too well now|pg||

nt|OleBerg:  Undo :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|nilsland:	2N+1 is a good result for the Dutch here|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  1NT can systematically be this distribution, if there are concentration of values in the short suits|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  (Other 5-4-2-2 are possible, but no 5-card major on such types.)|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  and the lternative, 2@C, doesn'really look tasty.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  (2@C opening, showing 6+ clubs, or 5+ clubs and a major, as in classic precision)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But even 2@H could be in trouble|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|sybarra: @S thru now would have been interesting  |pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Likely to make, but an unprecise declarer could fall astray|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|sybarra: trying to passant the 10 @H with spade thru |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  I think declarer would welcomed a spade through. Looks like the 8.th trick to me|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Declarer simply discards a loser on the third spade, and another on a now high @SK|pg||
nt|nilsland:  or 9|pg||

nt|adriaantje: skip that 'or not'|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|an|5+!hs|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|adriaantje: funny that they would have found their @S fit after a 1@S opening, but he's probably happy now they didn't after this 1@S overcall by N|pg||
mb|p|nt|adriaantje: 4@H by E seems to make, seeing all cards|pg||
nt|adriaantje: but on a trump lead, you need to play a @C to the A, the K unexpectedly dropping for a fast discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: and if EW finds their 5-3@s then 4@s might be reached -- and N will be happy to dbl -- but thats not happening here|pg||
nt|pelu:  I exp S to bid 5@d now|pg||
nt|adriaantje: hi Peter|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have results from the closed room after this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: N has called for the Tournament director|pg||
nt|adriaantje: why?|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: They have just HEARD discussions from another boards|pg||
nt|bebechira: from other table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: at another table some dicussions was going on about another board - about a squeeze in a slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: how did they know the board number?|pg||
nt|adriaantje: we all know those players with a voice that is a bit too loud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: and now North and East both heard the discussion going on - and would like to tell the TD that there might be a	problem later on|pg||
nt|adriaantje: maybe they don't know, but they may still recognise it|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: ok, we'll see later on then|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: yes -- that was the TDs advice too|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|bebechira: eaach table has their own set of boards Jan?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzee: own set yes -- but the same distributions used in the OPEN and the WOMEN team matches|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|adriaantje: 3@H cue probably already implies some @D support|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bebechira: not many tables shold play board 16 then|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: I think the TD has tried to have the different tables starting with different boards|pg||

pc|h2|nt|adriaantje: cross-ruff will bring 10 tricks home|pg||

nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But as the clubs lay, the defence was short of options|pg||
nt|nilsland:  this looks interresting|pg||
mb|2C|nt|OleBerg:  I do believe EW has a gadget for opening this one 1@S, and later showing it in some sequence|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4H|nt|OleBerg:  If they have, he chose not to employ it.|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NS have only 2 losers but are not making 5@D|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|OleBerg:	But 4@H must be very close to making|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|nt|nilsland:  4@H is a practical bid and I agree with Ole - it may make|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Not a bad agreement. "If you bid gane the first time it is your time to bid, then it is natural."|pg||
nt|nilsland:  West should return a trump|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Only exception is a 4@H bid after a constructive opening/overcall of 1@S by partner|pg||
nt|nilsland:  he knows declarer has no suit to establish|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Cannot blame South for 5@D|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  2@D is a little dubious, but the hand rather good|pg||
nt|nilsland:  if I was asleep and someone waked me up I will return a trump here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: can not blame S,  no defense really,	not even sure a @D would cash |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|OleBerg:  You ould return a trumf even if they didn't wke you up :)|pg||
