mb|d|mb|2C|an|drury, 3 card max passed hand raise|mb|2N|mb|3S|nt|mrdct:  hi everyone|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: NS open very aggressively so this hand won't be 11 counts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: NS play 2/1splitting their balanced ranges between 1C and 1D|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Double dummy, 4@S can be made, I suppose.	|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs:  But it's not a great contract, and realistically, you are more likely to go down|pg||
nt|mrdct:  not such a great contract on a trump lead|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|bjacobs:  I would expect a trump switch here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i expect a trump switch now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  That limits declarer to one diamond ruff, and so declarer has to choose between taking the diamond finesse or trying to ruff out the king, short|pg||
nt|mrdct:  good result for ewart in the other room|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yes, Lucy Henbest played to ruff out the king short!|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: The double probably helps with that decision|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so it's K third or doubleton in either hand or K onside but not 5 fifth|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Come to think of it, maybe it's the best play ... finessing is necessary only when East has K-fourth|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Lucy got a double from East too which probably made it harder, good job by her|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Let's see, West has doubled and shown up with 2 spades.  So probably 2443 or 2434|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i can't do the maths, but seems there are few more chances ruffing a @d|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: and ak of clubs|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  I have the feeling North thought he was inviting slam with his sequence, but South didn't	get the message|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jkdood: And 2 slams in a row for NS|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6NT is easy|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an|4SGF|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|jkdood: ducking a heart works and the @Cs are like heaven|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 2@S is fourth-suit-forcing|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|an|1st or 2nd|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: West has no real attractive opening lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkdood: Other room surprisingly stopped in 3N (making 7)|pg||
nt|jkdood: With 33 high, not a good auction|pg||
nt|jkdood: SO we may see the score 66-65 or such, with 1 board left in the half|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|bjacobs:  well in that case, it's North who was questionable.  |pg||
nt|mrdct:  NS keep getting the good hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|bjacobs:  But this is another situation where the use of 4NT as quantitative can be invaluable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  3NT my bold prediction|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: would be quant here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|bjacobs:  you mean in this auction (board 32) Laura?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so it looks like we'll go to the lunch break with the match almost tied|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: quant on both. |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|mrdct:  however - lucy henbest may have found alosing line in 6NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  That's how I play it.  After a transfer and simple accept, 4NT is quant.  To Blackwood, you have to go other ways|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|mrdct:  which is going to swing 26 imps or so|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|nt|bjacobs:  you might go down in 6NT if you play towards @CJ?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  that's what she did|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs:  Unfortunate|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d6|nt|bjacobs:  Didn't see that coming, but I wouldn't rush into print saying it was a misplay|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mrdct:  so instead of being close to a tie - thompson will lead at teh half by 25 or so|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: really no need for quant in the 6S auction as you can make a mild slam try through 3NT and still get to play in 4M|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: bids after the transfer and accept would show shortage|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  On THEIR methods, yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But in Standard, that 3NT is not a slam try, it is a contract|pg||
nt|mrdct:  what time is the restart laura?|pg||
mc|11|nt|vugrapha1: restart for the next match is scheduled for 220, If teams agree we may be back earlier. eg 2pm|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: See you all here for the next segment where Ewart have seating rights |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: restart in 55. see you then|pg||
