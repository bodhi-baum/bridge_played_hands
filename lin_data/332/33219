nt|jkdood: EW can win 6 if they stop low enough|pg||
nt|jkdood: 3NT "should not" make EW, of course we have seen worse come home at times|pg||
nt|jkdood: West might "guess" to pass this, which would be good for EW|pg||
nt|jkdood: Not 100% sure its passable though|pg||
nt|jkdood: I suspect they have discussed this sequence in depth, but it is quite unusual, so maybe not|pg||
nt|jkdood: West may try 3@H like, well i have something here, for help in 3N|pg||
nt|jkdood: But that hides his longer major, so quite a problem|pg||
nt|jkdood: East has pretty much announced he has no interest in playing in a major, so all West bids cater to 3N 5@C or 5@D games|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: WD by Andy Mill, and 6 imps reward expected|pg||

nt|mrdct:  i guess looking at 2 hands only, bad things could happen in 2@cxx so 3NT does make sense|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: 3C promises reversing values|pg||
nt|mrdct:  11-14b is the most common hand type for 1@c openings and it's good to be able to nail down what sort of suport partner has and know about 4 card support immediately|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2C probably some multi way, I think there was discussion about limit raises |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well it seems to me that distinguishing between 2 card and 3 card support is pretty useful also, so I'm not convinced|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but i guess it;'slargely just a personal preference|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think the theory is that after 1@c:1X, a fit in Y is more likely to be 4-4 than 5-3 or something like that|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and you get good value out of the auctions that go 1@c:1X:2Y|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: results from yesterday are at http://www.vba.bridgeaustralia.org/teamresults.asp?id=1557|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but i've never claimed to be a good bidding theoriest|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  No problem with the jump to 2 showing 4.  But if simply accepting the transfer shows 3, and bidding something else denies 3, well that seems very handy|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: results from today will be at http://www.vba.bridgeaustralia.org/teamresultsko.asp?id=1558&umbid=0  |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: team Thompson came into the day with a 16imp carry forward|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the something else for 2-card suport is problematic though as you need to take away some other bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Not really, I am back to Standard bidding.  1NT for example is always there|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  Anyway, Ewart has moved on, which seems pretty reasonable to me.  But the breaks are fairly horrid on this layout|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  for me, i like to keep 1NT rebid as strong balanced to avoid unnecessary 2NT contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  the trump break will make this hard|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs:  Nothing breaks|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Unfortunate, but I reckon it's a pretty fair contract nevertheless|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: could the heart pips prove interesting?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  don't think so|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yeah it sort of just needs one of the Majors to break|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  Perhaps 2 rounds of trumps now, and a club|pg||
nt|mrdct:  now he'll draw 2 rounds of trumps and decide whether or not to ruff a @c or play for @H3-3|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Ewart is a 4 person team as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I don't think he will play for hearts 3-3 after that opening lead.  Well, I wouldn't|pg||
nt|mrdct:  no - @c break seem more likely|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But when the 4-1 trump break comes to light, he probably does have to play on hearts|pg||
