nt|reisig: I try to improve my partner :)  |pg||
nt|ritong: so, when south bids 3@s here, it s rather " please pick a spot between 3NT and 4@s"|pg||

nt|ritong: complex hand|pg||
nt|ritong: hooking the @d J can provide nine quicks|pg||
nt|ritong: but there are other sources|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	yes, but playing on clubs requires them to be 3-3, and you might never take two spade tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: and, in the process of setting the other source(@cs), you get an entry to play twice towards @d KQ|pg||
