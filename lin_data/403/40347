nt|jcwla:  So both NS pairs had problems with 6, Baker-McCallum ended in 3NT-2 for a push.|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Then what have you gained?|pg||

nt|BobThomson:  Then why not bid 7@H directly, and remove all ambiguity?  Despite the result, I think 7@H is the right bid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting question   5N-6@C-6@D vs  5N-6@C-6@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conclusion   preempts work -- south had to guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and ending discussion  the voices above  say  (5@D)-6@D = pick a major|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I would think after the first seven boards NS might expect to be down in the match. Query whether S would therefore want to take a sure plus or take advantage of a possible swing opportunity and take it to the limit.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@H bid a favorite of Big Clubbers|pg||

nt|ritong: at my table it would go 1@h 1@s 2@s 3@s|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h swish|pg||
mb|1S|mb|4H|nt|ritong: big @c sort of impacts this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: big clubbers LOVE the wide range jump to 4M|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|Vugraphzff: Yes we do. :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it can either be the traditional pure preempt or 3-fit bad random opening bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but Bjerkan guessing to bid immediately with unexceptional strength is a mystery|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ritong: this is less cold than it seems|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agreement that i've seen is that DBL by opener says -- interested in save if you are weak   or  defending if you have opening bid w/3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of Q1    closed room still on  12  so restart time dependent upon them|pg||

nt|ahollan1: not sure why not immediate 3@H  except maybe wants Stansby to declare to protect possible black suit tenaces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I'm a simple soul - I would bid 3@h over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla:  Wow, another potential pickup for Bjerkan.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: another guess -- perhaps DBL did NOT guaranteed 4@H|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||

nt|jcwla:  Thanks all, see you for more forthwith.|pg||
nt|kareno: No, west's double doesn't show hearts or east would have bid something to invite.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the auction strongly suggests [to me] that Stansby's DBL did NOT promise 4+@H|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Last board of the set.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final board of the set   teams can agree to restart earlier than posted schedule|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  EW did not bid game at the other table, so Bjerkan has a chance for a pickup|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: no spingold scores posted yet, but they will start to appear eventually at  http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe spingold started play either 30 min or 1 hour after our match|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzff: The Spingold is still without screens.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: So they started at 1:00|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: 3 more sets of 15 boards to play in this championship match|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Using screens adds about 2 minutes per board.  (more or less)|pg||

nt|ritong: there are eleven apparent tricks, but declarer can t ruff anything, so only ten|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  oh, right, it's only the first quarter|pg||
nt|ritong: sometimes there are blunders due to the fact that you automatically count five trump tricks with a 4/4 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in other room Stansby DBL did NOT promise @H length   so  Granovetter DBL was takeout, 2N scramble  and eventualy 3@H said 4@H, non-inv|pg||
