mb|d|an|Playing defense nb 2 of acbl suggestions|mb|p|an|Diamonds, 6 or more|nt|jkdood: Shane B playing with his dad, a player of many decades endurance and success|pg||
nt|jkdood: And the schenigh has been broken for the aurter by that one imp last deal|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 6@C is interesting here EW|pg||
nt|jkdood: But doomed	by breaks and @d finesse perhaps|pg||
nt|jkdood: 3N with @d lead and guess of @H is one way to 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|jkdood: A spy says next board is extra exciting... usually Al yells at me for that reveal so i wont elaborate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: in ACBL-land they can use written defenses against multi|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bob reading the defense, Shane thinking|pg||
nt|jkdood: hah one asked what scenigh is... its when in ginrummy you finally score points. named after Gin player schneider (famous) ima sure i misspelled it as usual|pg||
nt|jkdood: Hi and thanks to Rui our great Vu op (as usual also)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: thanks :)|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: This auction seems a bit on tilt?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Most at this level know Multi (and methods against) quite well; but hey it does create some issues|pg||
mb|6H|nt|jkdood: Someone suggested 3@H might be an advance showing @s and maybe one forgot?|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Well 6@h is better than 6@S anyway.. maybe 6N coming eventually|pg||
nt|jkdood: Seems thre accident we mentioned is what happened|pg||
nt|jkdood: a 6N accident would be rewarded with some defensive attacks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: bob checking again the notes|pg||
nt|jkdood: Lotsa guesses what went wrong and what will happen next, thx all|pg||
nt|jkdood: Nice to be in front at this stage for sure|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6N by W much better possible @D lead?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Too late for that here|pg||
mb|6N|nt|Vugraphzfd: director call|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: by lothan|pg||
nt|jkdood: They are allowed to look at Multi defense notes now but not other system notes|pg||
nt|jkdood: Quite likely opps will say alll the pauses and ponderings gave info... could be a ruckus on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: because bob took a pass, out of the bb, and then substituted by 6nt|pg||
nt|jkdood: If NS set 6N the ruckus will evaporate fast perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: TD ruled that the 6nt is allowed (correctly)|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: no alert on last pass, sorry|pg||
nt|jkdood: should go down easily we will see|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no screens at this stage|pg||

nt|jkdood: Its good to get some water (or pass some??? lol) when an accident like this occurs, also deep breaths|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some specs are right... a misguess and down a few still possible|pg||
nt|jkdood: The bidding and odds favor N having @HQ|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d6|nt|jkdood: That of course is due to it being a double game swing (plus some vig for the doubles)|pg||
