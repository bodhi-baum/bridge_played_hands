nt|ahollan1: that is true   their 2-bids show either 6+suit OR some singleton/void|pg||
nt|MrAce:  Specs asking why would they not transfer with 5@S, they go through stayman for other purposes, one of them is to avoid ending up playing 2 NT instead of 2@S with inv hands|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not telling fantunes what they should do:) i am telling to intermediate/advanced spectators that transfer is not magic and that there are mixed tactics possible with 5@ss|pg||

nt|ahollan1: rather than real game ambition|pg||
nt|ritong: he s thinking like " are you kidding me", but if it is not the case may get expensive to jump in|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: fantunes 2-bids   all show 10-13, 6+suit or some singleton/void,  qualifier is 2@H/2@S deny 4+ in other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough situation for Piekarek|pg||
nt|kareno: We don't have the CR auction but saving 5/5 isn't my style.	Heitner's first law:  The five-level belongs to the opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: immediate bid from pike might encourage partner too much|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  But 5@D should make|pg||
nt|kareno: Here we go again, doubling the only contract you can beat...|pg||
nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not to mention - having to guess @H vs @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: run baby run??|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in case u missed it   Karen make huge key point |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: CR auction: 4@s-p-p-X-p-5@d-5@sdppp|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, yes.  Just like they should have in 6@doubled in the Cayne match|pg||
nt|ritong: 6@s|pg||
nt|kareno: Right 6@s doubled|pg||
nt|ritong: someone doubled 6@s with @s Q10xxx or so  went one down  7@d and 7 NT makeable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: east should have made up adjective bid of	4@C transfer   then 4@D-P-4@H :)|pg||
nt|kareno: That is a huge mistake - and we have seen it over and over at various levels, including the World Women's Team in Australia|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Even with the heart rough on the opening bid one should drop the K@D|pg||
nt|kareno: I was doubled once by a many-times champion in 7@s when he held Txxxxx ... I removed to 7nt and claimed trick 1|pg||
nt|kareno: TXXXX actually behind me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can imagine votes for north opening bid ranging from 1@S thru 4@S   with only fantunes players including 2@S|pg||
nt|ritong: greed is a terrible thing|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Sorry ruff it has been a rough day;)|pg||

nt|kareno: Should??  Maybe could|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  I think he should have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Fantoni needed @DK for the opener but won't bet my own money|pg||
nt|shuster:  He was already subminimum in HCP... supposedly it starts at a good 10|pg||
nt|kareno: For the 3@s opener???|pg||
nt|shuster:  He might have has @SAKQJ, I suppose|pg||
nt|ahollan1: didn't he open 2@S?|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe, but who has the @s A?|pg||
mb|2H!|an|hearts + minor|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = @H & minor|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Would Fantoni open 2@S with AKQJxx. I think not|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  he would|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: maybe @H & 4+other|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kareno: Can't open 1 - it's forcing...|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|shuster:  I have a parter who loves the fantunes 2-bids, so we practice vu graph deals of just about every match they play. |pg||
nt|ritong: point is @h 7 called for a @s|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Would Nunes respond on xxx A hearts and K@D 2NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in upcoming bermuda bowl  piek would open 2@C to show 5+@H 5+other, 5-11|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think there you have your no, Paul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm thinking more from perspective of Fantoni having [good 9] 10-13 for 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: agree with Jack Oest in voice -- won't blame Piek for getting it wrong, but i'm wondering how to confidently get it right|pg||
nt|kareno: Use mirrors|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kareno: They restart when ready - maybe 15 minutes unless the CR is way behind|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I don't know which matches we'll have for the fourth quarter, but of course if some of the other matches start before we have finished we won't be able to change. We'll do the best ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we can|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@S = ASK stopper|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahh Jan had added "values"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: he gestured that it was strong, so that's my guess of what he meant :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they have not agreed a suit - but it will be @D or @C :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: piek would not bid 2@S with 4+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [sounds bizarre, doesn't it]|pg||
nt|ritong: the trap is bidding grand imo|pg||
nt|ritong: we have seen more weird things happen|pg||
nt|Paulhac:  Does Piekarek have any idea of partners distribution?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just knows primary @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my note says  2@S = ASK stopper (Hxx possible), (11)12+ HCP, not 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4N = values for 4N in this auction   [learned that explanation while in college  - made a lot of enemies]|pg||

nt|kareno: back in about fifteen or so|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Fantoni asking Piekarek about the auction, long discussion (whispered)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nunes has summoned the director, I don't know why. Fantoni & Piekarek still talking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet  he'll say BIT   [break in tempo]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: director and Smirnov away from table talking; P & F still talking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 3 sets   Lynch over Lavazza by TEN	that one has been close throughout|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I told the Lynch-Lavazza players we'd put them back on vugraph if they'd wait to start. It's up to them|pg||
