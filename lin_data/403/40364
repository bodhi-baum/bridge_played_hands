mb|p|mb|d|nt|TopWizard:  Zia X, Duboin 4@s, then . . . |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|ritong: raising takes room and a cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i think worth the possible supplementary 300|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Duboin seems way too strong for 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|4N|nt|warrens:  now we're off to the races.  |pg||
nt|TopWizard:  KC helps here|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think 4@H is reasonable the first time.	it's always tough against preempts|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Meckwell X's in N to say "don't lead a @s"|pg||
nt|ritong: low profile when preempted is a good idea|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|ritong: then when pard really has it you have extras|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Had Madala X|pg||
mb|3S|nt|TopWizard:  's himself, it would have suggested 5@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bocchi looking at Madala's hand from the last board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i advocated raising here other room|pg||
nt|ritong: go for it!:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: yes!|pg||
mb|d|nt|jkdood: 7@S sac here actually gains a nice bit of imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  There is actually a double squeeze here to make 7@h w/o a @c lead|pg||
nt|ritong: i somehow doubt they bid the grand now|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@s is a real stab|pg||
nt|jkdood: 11 imp gain if trump not led|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ritong: although..|pg||
nt|ritong: will he take the risk to bid a grand off the trump ace?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: truism:  if you give opponents enough chances to go wrong, they'll eventually go wrong|pg||
nt|jkdood: perfect defense of 7@Sx will net 5 imps to Lavazza|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Many prefer to call it "pressure bidding"|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6@S may force the issue?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: source of that line   "platitudes from a can"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bad joke that most won't recognize -- sorry about that|pg||
nt|ritong: berra was a master|pg||
