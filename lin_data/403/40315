nt|ahollan1: Responder who uses Puppet Stayman of 2N or 3@C  will NEVER have 4@H & 4@S	- that hand just uses 2@C Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so either 1 4-card major or no 4M, looking for 53 fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there are a few reasons to use 2N as [modified] Puppet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1) eliminates possible lead-directing dbl of 3@C|pg||
