mb|p|nt|jkdood: Other room in 3N NS this board|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 3N an easy make|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|jkdood: And 6@D a nice spot also|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jkdood: Maybe 7@D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: lots of writing; cannot see any of it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jkdood: I suspect 1@D showed H and 1@H denied spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Many hide a @D suit over the equivalent of a better minor 1@C opener, sometimes the @D suit is lost for good|pg||
nt|jkdood: They hide @D to show a 4card major right away, even with 5@D|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Of course some elegant pairs have ways to show @D later, but far from all|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Seems they might find the @D slam at this juncture|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: They are both so rich in controls|pg||
nt|jkdood: 1st and 2nd round control all 4 suits, maybe 7 isnt that farfetched|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Seems makeable (7@D) with careful timing|pg||
nt|jkdood: But ya hate to be in 7 when 6 will win 10+ imps|pg||
nt|jkdood: 7@d isnt great but its far from a terrible spot that just happens to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Sometimes the state of match and who you play is more important than percentages (quote from legend Vic Mitchell)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jkdood: So this is well done for maybe 12 imps to the leading team added on if make, which seems assured|pg||

nt|jkdood: East should raise!|pg||
nt|jkdood: He knows West was too good for 3@S or 4@S|pg||
nt|jkdood: 4@S over 3@D is NOT a preempt it is a strong hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: E asking N about preempt style|pg||

nt|jkdood: Just having @S Q seems enough for the raise|pg||
