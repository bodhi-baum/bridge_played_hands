mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North would prefer better spade spots but 4333 is too balanced for anything else|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  with the @dA and @hK quite possibly with the 1NT overcaller, declarer must think of a throw in|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  can ruff a club, draw trumps (via marked finesse) and arrange for North to win the hearts|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	He can easily make 7 tricks but the 8th is hard work|pg||

nt|paulg:  But if declarer plays on hearts, as is likely, then North will get endplayed when he wins the @h10|pg||
nt|paulg:  so Barton has a chance because he has the @h9 ... of course he would not have opened without this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  South may try to defeat the endplay by playing the @hJ, but the @h9 is still the key card|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:	West can take control|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	As long as East has the missing ace 13 tricks should be asy|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  The snag for West is that 4NT at once would be keycard with spade king counting as ace|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|pdjourdain:  Which is why he wants to set hearts as trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|pdjourdain:  Now East's response only counts ace of diamonds as a key card but NOT spade king|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	However I think Laura has shown two so that makes West's bid easier!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark:  East thinks spades are trump anyway |pg||
mb|5N|nt|cuttysark:  I wold have thought @DA and @SK were enough....|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|pdjourdain:  He must be hoping for more than 13 tricks!|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@h will be game forcing|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|paulg:  2@s is forcing but will be used for hands with six spades and also those that are weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  Spears might bid 3NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:	and this makes life difficult for West, but he'll probably continue with 4@c, cue bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  In the old days West could start with 3@h, a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|paulg:  and get the power of his hand across immediately|pg||
nt|paulg:  4@c should be a self-agreeing cue bid here ... with a real club suit West would have bid it on the previous round|pg||
