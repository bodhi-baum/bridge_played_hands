nt|pdjourdain:  E-W will go to at least 4@H|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hanlon may decide D are 4-0 and finesse|pg||
mb|d|nt|pdjourdain:  So the key is whether they go to 5@H over 5@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 10 tricks maximum  once 1 round of trumps played  in heart contract|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  McGann wondering whether he has bid his suit often enough |pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  Forrester a big fan of doubling with a void in opponent's suit to let partner make the decision|pg||
