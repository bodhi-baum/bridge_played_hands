mb|1N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East is a bit good for openeing 1@d and rebidding 2@d and a bit weak for openeing 1@d and rebidding 3@d|pg||
nt|roswolf:  in the other room 3nt got a heart lead and the contract still made!!!|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Forrester apparently considering 5-card Stayman (if they have that method available).|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hence 1NT opening|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  2@c asks opener to rebid 2@d but not sure what hands that covers|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  there will be a few questions asked :)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  It seems to me that Allfrey misdefended at the other table. He could count 8 tricks for declarer in 3NT, so he should put Robson with the @SA, ditch his spades and keep the hearts to cash the @DQ.|pg||
