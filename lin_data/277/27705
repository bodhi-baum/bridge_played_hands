nt|pdjourdain:  NI made Four spades for 420|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mamos:  predicting flat or even flattish boards has been somewhat hazardous in this competition  but that looks a normal outcome|pg||
nt|toobad: 5c only 2 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: The event website for results, reunning scores, conv cards etc is here - http://ladymilne.sbueast.org.uk/|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|mamos:  South has upgraded to 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  It looks as if 4@S should be beaten by a heart ruff as East has no quick entry to take the spade finesse|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mamos:  2@d  showed Spades and a second suit |pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  and 4@H can be beaten by a spade ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: thank you - no questions asked at the table yet|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:  so NI did well to make a game E-W.|pg||
nt|mamos:  ASptro|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|pdjourdain:  Can diane K also get away with ten tricks?|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  N Ireland had a very good first half to the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the Welsh players need to forget about the scoreboard and concentrate on doing their best in the second half... not easy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the nearly live table is at http://ladymilne.sbueast.org.uk/matches.php|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  If Northern Ireland can pick up a few more IMPs, they could overtake Wales|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  the auction here seems to be 180% out|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South has opened 1Nt and the 2@c bid showing the majors belongs to West|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so East has become declarer in 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: When lead was made both hands attempted to be dummy, so director has been called|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer's problem is getting to hand to take the spade finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzbx: reverse the auction|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a club lead, diamond switch and return to clubs will keep declarer out of hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if NS find that, they will be pleased|pg||
