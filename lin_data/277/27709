nt|Henryb:  In a bidding contest 6N would get 10 of 10, 6@h about 4|pg||
nt|eamongall: well 10 out of 12 as several pairs would be bidding it |pg||
nt|roswolf: well i must say i thought they WEREin 6nt - but the 4 leaf clover has worked|pg||

nt|Henryb:  The English East in the other room played this hand for about as few tricks as she could. But she may end up winning imps |pg||
