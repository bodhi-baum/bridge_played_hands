mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|an| |mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle:  6D available, but lucky. On a club lead, you can draw trumps and pitch the losing spade on the hearts. On a spde lead, you get two pitches for clubs on the top spades|pg||

nt|woozle:  Might get trumps wrong, though, if you start with low to the king (but if trumps are 3-1, how can you make?)|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||

nt|rhelle: sound policy|pg||
nt|woozle:  It's not the badness, although I pass poor 12s (rarely) - it's that it's a horrible hand in standard methods|pg||
nt|rhelle: now there is plenty of scope for getting this wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: we know that the contract is unmakeable if trumps are 3-1, but how good is this West player?|pg||
nt|woozle:  Someone's noticed that when you open 1D with that shape you're a huge chance to end up as dummy. This may be part of my reasoning|pg||
nt|rhelle: hahahaha|pg||
nt|woozle:  Playing pro, I don't like to hog but that doesn't mean that I have to beg to be dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: the only chance now is to draw trumps and throw the losing @s on the 4!th @h|pg||
nt|rhelle: then you can ruff the last losing @c in the short hand|pg||
nt|woozle:  the only chance that works today, anyway|pg||
nt|rhelle: there are alternatives, as more eminent members of the community are poining out to me|pg||

nt|woozle:  Not the greatest bridge autobiography - that might be reserved for Sontag's "The Bridge Bum"|pg||
nt|woozle:  East won't be enjoying this opportunity to lead. HQ might be his best bet|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, that was a good read too. A bit dated now, I think 30 years old|pg||
nt|woozle:  The chapter on hustling is particularly special|pg||
nt|woozle:  North has eight top tricks at the moment, and a spade or a diamond immediately concedes a ninth...a heart will too, but slightly more slowly|pg||
nt|woozle:  So there will be at most one imp exchanged on this board - not much use to the team trailing|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, and East will be pinched again to conced another one|pg||
