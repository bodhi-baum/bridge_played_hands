pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: tarzan precision in action|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like a finesse for J of @c almost mandatory for declarer|pg||
nt|pelu:  need to play @c to 10 to make - would be a nice play if she find out|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Peter|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|pelu:  :(|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should have brought it up earlier	  IF you play Drury with your partner, do you have a way for responder to show a good hand with @C?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|pelu:  Hi Abndy I just followed Justin and Jason H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|nt|andyv:  being vul, if you are wrong with @c finesse, it could be 3 imps if the same contract in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and they aren't the only Hacketts on that team|pg||
nt|pelu:  a perfect squeze - on partner :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't Al...I just bid 1NT and hope to be able to bid again later|pg||
pc|c5|pc|sT|pg||
nt|pelu:  worked better if S just duck @c to K|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other way to approach my question   what are  P-1M-2N	 P-1M-3@C|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|andyv:  if not playing mini splinters, 3@c could show that type of hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another common approach   3@C = fit-showing  and 2N=@C 1-suiter|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|h8|mc|7|nt|ahollan1: key is   "let's play drury"   can't end the discussion|pg||
