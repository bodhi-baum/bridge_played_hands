pc|sK|nt|Clinch: But 3@h will make :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This pair not quite in agreement as to what is forcing or not|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: classic problem faced by n/s if you dont - is 3@H to play or is it forcing ... ?|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: good/bad 2NT asks pd to bid 3C and now 3H is competitive - 3H direct is a much better hand.	Similarly 3C is forcing and to play in @C pass the forced 3@C over 2NT|pg||

nt|roswolf: ty|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Interesting rebid problem for South|pg||
nt|Henryb:  3@h would not be forcing|pg||
nt|mamos:  South knows bidding wont stop|pg||
nt|Henryb:  3@c probably is|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed 3@c or maybe dbl or 3@S|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now the slam is on to be bid|pg||
nt|Henryb:  so I would solve this the same way: 3@c, then 4@h over 4@c|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: now 6@C is auto matic surely|pg||
nt|Henryb:  6@c needs 3-2 clubs, 4-2 hearts|pg||
nt|Henryb:  A decent slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: objectively perhaps but momentum should work|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: hooray -well judged i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Henryb:  So @sA, @s ruff, @hA, @h ruff, @cAQ, @d ruff and draw the last trump|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Henryb:  Easy from here; perhaps not as easy to see at the table - and you will go down a lot if suits do not break reasonably|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c6|pc|s7|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|c8|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Henryb:  then if clubs are 4-1 onside, you can draw trump and pray for 3-3 hearts|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will work as well with @h3-3|pg||
