nt|jbgood:  you micht wonder how E got an uptrick here - his 9 of @d took the last trick:)'|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome to the white house :) |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|BroLucius:  North fine for 1@D overcall nowadays. Used to be a take-out double.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jbgood:  Hi David |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|BroLucius:  Note that a negative double would be poor by East on such a shapely hand. Hardly any chance that West would hold a major|pg||
nt|tias:  exciting!|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Hi, Jon! |pg||
nt|tias:  I dont hope he pulls to 4@s now!!!|pg||
mb|r|nt|BroLucius:  Anyway, Even if West held better spades than hearts, might play OK with hearts as trumps.|pg||
nt|tias:  WOW|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: wow indeed|pg||
nt|tias:  5@d doesnt make, so NS in trouble now|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Dble = 'I don't think they can make this!'   Rdble = 'Really?'|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: everyone at the table awake now :) |pg||
nt|jbgood:  not sure 5@d is much better... |pg||
nt|BroLucius:  South cannot run, at this score.|pg||
nt|tias:  I dont think either.|pg||
nt|jbgood:  point is what he thinks:)|pg||
nt|tias:  Playing against mighty Dennis Bilde i WOULD think twice, thats for sure! :)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Players tend to redouble when they are not quite sure that the contract will make. If they are certain to make, and a sacrifice may be cheap, they just accept the double.|pg||
nt|tias:  but at non-vul against vul he knows there is no good sacrifice (i think)|pg||
nt|jbgood:  so true in general - but juniors often want to make their mark...|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: South in the tank now|pg||
nt|tias:  I do think, that 5@dX is cheaper than 4@h XX though...|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North might have said something over 1NT if 5@D is cheap opposite this South hand. South should take note of that.|pg||
nt|tias:  880 is hard to compete against|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tias:  anyway 5@dX it is|pg||
pc|hK|nt|BroLucius:  If E/W spades were 4-3, on some different lay-out, the defenders would have scored AK of spades and a ruff, plus the @DA. So, defensive situation not hopeless from South's point of view.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tias:  I agree. I would not have pulled.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Anyway, South always has the fallback that he can tell others: 'My partner went 1100 off on Board 31. That's why we lost IMPs.' Better than when you have to play the contract yourself.|pg||

mb|4N|an| |mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|BroLucius:  I recently wrote a chapter on 2@C auctions for a beginners' bidding quizbook. It made me realize how difficult it was to bid after such a start.|pg||

mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  2@D from responder covers such a large range and he then has so little space to demonstrate his values. Not so bad after a positive.|pg||
