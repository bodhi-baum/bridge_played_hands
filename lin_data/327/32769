nt|vugraphzcp: no play, just trumps and a claim|pg||
nt|arvidsson2: but a well deserved 11 imps to ned. for reaching that top spot|pg||
nt|ady: I think the re-double from south shows 3 of each major	so west shoulod know of a likely singleton heart with east|pg||

nt|arvidsson2: 4@S is a superior contract to 3nt in 68% of the time (@S 3-2) and 3nt is slightly better if @S does not break|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: East is in the tank |pg||
nt|arvidsson2: 3@H support|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson2: so E is facing a partner that bids game opposite a minimum hand|pg||
nt|arvidsson2: s is considering the save, since possible double fit in @S +@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: West explaining 1 @C opening|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: North and East talking about the 1 NT bid|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H seem to muchin a hurry    could have been passed out  with 13 tricks available|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|arvidsson2: hard to reach 4@S on 5-2|pg||
nt|arvidsson2: but with just 1 @H stopper 4@S is the winner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|arvidsson2: so 4th best found, and declarer is facing 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|arvidsson2: declarer have a small chance of making this|pg||
nt|arvidsson2: if choosing to play on endplay in @H, to force 2@S tricks|pg||
nt|arvidsson2: but the normal line is to just take the @S finesse|pg||

nt|ady: declarer might succeed taking 2nd heart and cashing the diamonds    east has some awkward discards  and might get end played with 3rd heart from north later in the play     but ...|pg||
nt|ady: difficult line to take |pg||
nt|arvidsson2: declarer took the normal line|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: East in the tank now|pg||
