nt|jkdood: Despite West's lack of a quick entry, EW's spades should make this a down 1 hand likely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jkdood: West's signaling seems consistent with wanting a spade shift|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other table is also in 1NT but by EW|pg||
nt|jkdood: EW has the tempo as long as they dont allow NS a club trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Declarer ducks a spade, then leads a club for 90?|pg||
nt|Harmon: Levin found a great lead|pg||
nt|jkdood: He cannot duck a spade if West is high of course|pg||
nt|jkdood: 4@h 1@S 2@C down 1|pg||
nt|jkdood: Although it compromises the suit, West should overtake 9@S with ten for the set|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|mc|8|nt|lrobb98:  Remember the final hand of a major not long ago, where these 2 pairs were playing, and Helgemo/Helness were in 1NT recoubled to swing the match??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: after 1.5 boards???|pg||
nt|meargent: now all rod needs for 9 tricks is @SA onside @Hs playing for 4 tricks and @DA on side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if any europeans still awake -- is that allowed in your tournaments??|pg||

nt|meargent: thats because the cards ly unluckily for declarer|pg||
nt|kareno:  Well, Joey, he already got a trick on the lead.|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he assumes 3 aces with East, he has to consider finessing for the @h jack|pg||
pc|h9|nt|casenjo:  yes, ducking by Nunes hurts Rodwell|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jkdood: These 4 players were once teammates in big events|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  If Levin had popped A at trick 1, it would have provided the extra entry to lead clubs twice...|pg||
nt|jkdood: The play in 3N at the other table is laborious and slow|pg||
nt|jkdood: A lot of imps on the line for the result|pg||
nt|jkdood: The finals of the Vanderbilt in a close match will not be  speed race; good to have your TV or ipad nearby for distraction|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Levin deeply thinking|pg||

pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: popup only works for browser-based bbo|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and voice|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||

nt|jkdood: 4@Cs?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|glenne:  yes, enough to make three clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|lrobb98:  on that last hand, declarer had to lead a club to have a chance, before getting out with a 3rd spade...|pg||
nt|jkdood: Of course its NS's hand somehwere but where?|pg||
nt|glenne:  four hearts, with aid of info provided by 2NT bid|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jkdood: There would be a hopeful endposition in @ds if West did not have that pesky 9|pg||
nt|glenne:  diamond nine will foil an endplay...but what if he draws two rounds of trump, and cashes heart ace and ducks a heart to East? (finessing trump obviously)|pg||
nt|glenne:  wont that work?|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  tricky here to go down only 1...|pg||
nt|Harmon: no just covers spade or overtakes ht|pg||
nt|glenne:  right|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5@S 3@H 1@D is easy 9 tricks, so my aunt might be down just 1 as well|pg||
nt|jkdood: "are" 9 easy tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glenne:  where your aunt makes nine Helness mightmake ten....|pg||
nt|jkdood: The third board was also down 1 in other room, push|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  sneaky little 4 of diamonds...|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|jkdood: If Levin won this and had ZERO spades, would be a good position for NS to create|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some of the variations that create hope suffer from lack of entries, like a @D up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fyi:  Jan Martel is posting scores from the Swiss Teams  on www.usbf.org|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Harmon: actually cash 1 hts spade to king and a heart wouldve worked I think|pg||

nt|kit: and no more ace of diamonds entry to dummy|pg||
nt|sixela: not so bad, forced into the winning trump play right away|pg||
nt|kit: of course if he just guesses the hearts and ruffs a club, he has 6 hearts, 3 spades 2 diamonds, and 1 club|pg||
nt|kit: And that straightforward line of play may well be best|pg||
nt|sixela: he may duck the K, dangerous but makes life easier if it works|pg||
nt|kit: no way he will duck the king of diamonds|pg||
nt|sixela: seems wildly unlikely|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  if he just gives up on stiff Q in S hand, and low to J, if that holds he is pretty good..then spade A and a ruff...that is seeing all 4 hands, but is reasonable line....|pg||
nt|kit: I do like the straightforward line -- ace of diamonds, ace of clubs, club ruff, ace of hearts, heart planning on finessing|pg||
nt|sixela: i prefer playing h right away, you need to find the Q on and it makes life much easier|pg||
