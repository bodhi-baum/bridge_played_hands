pc|c9|pg||
nt|jkdood: Quite apart from here; EW did not take any bids at all on the auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Probably the choice of whether to open the E hand had a lot to do with system - it's more attractive to open 1@d when it shows 4+ diamonds than when it might be 2|pg||
nt|jkdood: Also true @S lead will set up a ruff for defense, another way to set 4@H|pg||
nt|jkdood: It was a third seat opening of course; different standards abound|pg||
nt|jkdood: Gordon will be down at both tables, for a moderate imp loss they do not need|pg||
nt|jkdood: (Not that any team "needs" it, but you know what i mean)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pepsi asks about signalling again and Levin explains that they play standard signals on A/K lead at trick 1 - "I told you, we play standard at trick 1 on A/K lead" |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 7@H is also interesting! And tough|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: rest was cue bidding|pg||
nt|jkdood: Affer pulling trump its like being in 7NT so the club lead is an issue, of course he may try to ruff a spade early aftera  @C lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Some more discussion, but EW basically say that after 3NT there aren't any specific agreements. Pretty sure that 5@c and 5@d were cue bids.|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  3-3 is 36%, and the danger is S having only 2, but still has the luck of 9 and 10 of H with N..which does not come home here|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes he can make it if he hooks diamonds and use K of H for an early entry and club for a late entry IF no @C lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin: "So all we know is that you showed 4 @ds and he showed 4 @hs, we don't know anything else for sure?" Pepsi: "and he has a game forcing hand and I'm 4333 or (23)44 ... I ...|pg||

pc|dA|nt|jkdood: 11 tricks actually feasible|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lrobb98:  Smith is a good convention(after pard leads vs NT, your next play, if following to declarer's suit, tells pard whether you like his suit or not...attitude toward his lead..reverse Smith is like upside down, where a low one now says you like it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s2|nt|jkdood: Also good to use SMith's extension, where what you signal about opening lead also reveals if you like (or can stomach) the "obvious shift" suit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  he has to guess, and he(declarer) is getting a bit squozen...self squozen here....|pg||
nt|jkdood: understandably, the creative lead of J from Ajx created many scary illusions|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  2 probs with Smith:1.it adds to what you have to think about, which is alot anyway, and 2. players OFTEN blow a defense because their pard gave them a 2 vs. a 3, forgetting Smith..always follow bridge logic of the hand, which trumps Smith|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  pitching a H was right, on this hand, but a bit scary with the J lead....|pg||
nt|jkdood: Smith also creates a tempo issue that is too revealing in some cases with those that over-use it|pg||
nt|Harmon: players make the tempo issue|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  when dummy hits, you need to have a very active brain, thinking about declarers points, distro, pards points, the bidding yada yada..Smith adds one more thing to a (tired and addled) mind....that is the downside...|pg||
nt|jkdood: At this point you might as well pitch 2 more on the clubs then AK @S and exit a spade, let them come to you|pg||
nt|jkdood: Looks so easy from "up here" huh|pg||
nt|jkdood: Ahhh i didnt realize both clubs weren't high, thanks specs, sorry|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  this is the type of hand that leads to your head spinning, when you go down, and then it is tuff to just go on and concentrate, your head is in a fog...|pg||
nt|jkdood: Too busy with the Smith echo...|pg||
nt|jkdood: All previous comments about this outcome withdrawn, your honor...|pg||
nt|jkdood: So there is an issue in each and every one of the 4 suits, cool....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  the only suit he knows about is clubs...everything else is an educated guess....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pepsi reading his book again as Levin thinks|pg||

nt|jkdood: Then a @H. they can get 1@H and 2@D but thats all|pg||
nt|jkdood: Can he find that line with ehat he knows and has seen?|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  problem with leading spades, is he now skewers entries to both hands...he may be wishing that he inserted the Q of diamonds..altho at the time it was very unclear...|pg||

nt|po-s: unless to play...case for six key and two key queens|pg||
nt|warrens:  I would have preferred minor KC over 3@c, maybe 4@d|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  10 years ago it was more common to ask for 3rd round control, then bidding evolved into groping and showing at 6 level for best strain....|pg||
nt|meargent: seems west is asking himself that very question PO|pg||
nt|chorush: I would have thought that 4C set clubs as trump in which case I dont understand the 5 heart response|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pepsi wrote "asks about the Q of @cs I hope"|pg||
nt|dburn: look, guys - we have no idea what is actually going on in these auctions and these players' minds. If they knew what they were doing they would have done it by now.|pg||
nt|sixela: 4d over 3c would have avoided the confusion|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Well we know Pepsi at least thought 6@C asked about Q|pg||
nt|meargent: aint science great?|pg||
nt|warrens:  Pepsi must have though|pg||
nt|warrens:  thought they were in an agreed @s RKC auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Pepsi "what's this - you answer in spades and now you pass 6@c?" So I guess he thought 4NT was KC for spades so 5@h showed 2 without and then 6@c asked for club Q|pg||

mb|2N|an|5 !S, minimum|nt|Vugraphzfd: berkowitz: can I pass now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Drawback of the 2C bid showing only 2 clubs is it makes it difficult for Meckstroth to know how valuable his club Q is. But they will get there in spite of that|pg||
mb|3C!|an|RKC !S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes, but they have lots of room for Rodwell to ask|pg||

mb|4C|mb|d|nt|warrens:  what is X here?|pg||
nt|dburn: penalties by all accounts, but no double below 7@s is for penalties nowadays|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think he made a rolling on gesture :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  must show a hand interested in bidding more|pg||
nt|meargent: nothing wrong playing complicated systems as long as they are willing to put in their 40 plus hours a week working on it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Levin asks Pepsi who shrugs - sort of saying no agreement|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  yes, as people bid lighter and lighter, we have evolved so that no X is penalty!!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: and even doubles of 7@s show transferable values|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Levin will still bid 5|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  the early X may have worked here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now they discuss it further and Levin (whom I can just hear) says "so he has a 4@h bid and wants to set up a forcing pass?" and Pepsi nods|pg||
