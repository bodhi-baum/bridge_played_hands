mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: 2@C not alerted, zmud points at it and shows the fist that means strength|pg||
nt|game over: a different bidding situation at the other table, East was probably limited to an invitational hand, which makes 5@c even more unlikely and 3NT is a shot|pg||

nt|bt:	see|pg||
nt|game over: one nuance is whether North has already denied a diamond fit with his 3@s bid (he could have bid 3@d or 4@d instead)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|bt:  nice 5@C here, lets see how they do|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lots of chat about the last board|pg||
mb|3D|nt|game over: this caters for a standard false card situation: AJ98x opposite xx, declarer would usually play to the 9, so you have to split from HTx to give him a chance to go wrong|pg||
mb|d|nt|KiwiBridge: 4 boards 24 imps still possible|pg||
nt|eamongall: He reckoned they lost more on the 6X-1 and 6X-2 ... then gained on the making ones |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: actually 7 boards yet to compare|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|KiwiBridge: A good lesson Eamon|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|bt:  and helgemo would do that|pg||

nt|game over: from my experience most good players often don't think about this play if xx is visible, but Helgemo would easily find it at the table|pg||
nt|bt:	this gets them to 5@C and tells hom how to play it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|KiwiBridge: Zia declines to reply?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: garner writes "2nt asks", rather|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: but I am reluctant to add explanations to any bid in the matrix since EW have been out of sync this set|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: H asking H why not bid 5@c|pg||
nt|bt:	on repeated club leads|pg||
nt|game over: double dummy this is relatively easy (given the friendly lie outside the heart suit), but single-dummy a very difficult contract|pg||
nt|bt:	diamond leads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: H says "I'm 4-3-1-5!"|pg||

nt|Harmon: you mean the stiff Q of c makes a diff to the 3d bid??|pg||
nt|game over: no,but the stiff Q makes no difference|pg||
nt|bt:	no, but if you lose to the stiff,  you can finesse again  |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: zmudzinski shakes his head.  zia yawns|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: amazing images|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|KiwiBridge: cold game no one cared :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  now he is forced to 4@H which is almost a make|pg||
pc|dK|nt|game over: West's hand is in the bottom range of take out doubles, a pass would be ok (but dangerous because it is difficult to enter the auction later)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfc: zia: I have three aces and I don't give partner a raise! even a little one!|pg||
nt|eamongall: bedtime 441am ...good night ...em morning ...I hear the biards |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: balicki: he passed. and we have 2@S spades and a minor. the most he can have is 5 spades and four in a minor|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Z "At least 4@s by Tor" laughter|pg||
nt|bt:	if east has @D Jx, a low back is good|pg||
nt|bt:	but I dont think he will|pg||
nt|bt:	@DQ is disastrous then|pg||
nt|bt:	tough decision|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|bt:  good shift|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|game over: with (likely) two spade tricks a hear return is pretty safe (unless declarer has @s KQ 6 hearts and @c C and three low diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Z shaking his head|pg||
nt|game over: @c K or @c Q|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Z "No way" Tor "Norway!" Tor "1 or 2"|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d5|pc|h6|pc|s6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: slams down @SK : this is a trick!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so the lineups tomorrow	monaco v lynch	  nickell v gordon|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 10-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks to Dan  our operator|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = usually 5+suit, 4@H/@S ONLY IF 6+suit, F1|pg||
nt|bebechira: so we have Monaco-Lynch and Nickell-Gordon tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: thanks, its been a long night   see you again soon|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if reopening DBL would suggest 6@C 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Willenken's 3@S certainly gave Bramley more of a problem than Zmudzinski's 2@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: but in other room 1@D was natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can't imagine getting @C right on this auction	 ---   even after the DBL|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: there was apparently a key card auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I guess maybe 4@H was kickback?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that does fit -- thanks Dan|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: well i got that part of the hand right|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: @S lead in other room  and Zia hooked north for @DJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: except garner still taking this seriously|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: aprt from this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: zia: if we lose by 1 IMP I'll be very sad|pg||
nt|game over: board 16 is the last board of this segment, three more segments to be played today, the next segment is scheduled to start in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|bt:	last hand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|game over: I would like to thank the vugraph operator for a tough job well done, Lars and the kiebitzers for their useful and funny comments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|bt:	thanks mathias and many thanks for putting up with me|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|KiwiBridge: Guess he will be excstatic then :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|bt:  danger signs for poland|pg||
nt|game over: 4@c = heart fit (I guess), 4@s = RKCB or spade cue (don't know)|pg||
nt|bt:	or lynch|pg||
nt|game over: but 4@s is certainly not natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Both apparently Q bids by Z|pg||
nt|bt:	east has a lot, I think he will find a spade shift at some point|pg||
nt|game over: it would be best if North "forgets" their agreement and passes now|pg||
nt|game over: as 3@h was not alerted, they probably don't know about their spade fit, so playing in spades is not an option|pg||
nt|bt:	maybe west should double given he knows partner has a few aces, thoughif they pull to spades ...|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Vugraphzfc: zia considering one more the road|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: since 4NT was not alerted we can conclude that 4@s was a cue bid and 4NT = RKCB|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: kibitzers cluster around for best view|pg||
nt|bt:	some more discussions on blackwood responses coming soon? ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: they play 102-responses  which translates to 41/30|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: zmudzinski pulls SJ himself and slams down SQ|pg||
nt|bt:	should helgemo double?|pg||
nt|bt:	anyone who thinks so?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Vugraphzfc: after SA says "good play"|pg||
nt|bt:	i dont know|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|game over: perhaps, should be clear to East who has all the points and a few hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bt:	the @CT should be ptretty clear|pg||
nt|bt:	pretty|pg||
nt|game over: and can yield a large reward (because East has two aces)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzfc: takes @DJ and says thank you|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h3|pc|s6|pg||
mc|10|nt|game over: so a second undertrick is worth a lot opposite 4@h -1|pg||
nt|bt:	then again, zmudzinski should know what to do |pg||
nt|game over: I don't think they will run to 4@s very often, but if you think they might, your judgement may differ|pg||
nt|game over: 5@s|pg||
nt|bt:	it is unusual to run to 5 over 5, I have never seen it|pg||
nt|bt:	would have been fun though|pg||
nt|game over: yes, because all finesses in spades are on..., but how often is this the case? I don't know|pg||
nt|bt:	thanks everyone|pg||
nt|bt:	bye 4 now|pg||
nt|game over: thanks, see you in 25 Minutes|pg||
