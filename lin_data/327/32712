mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does Bramley go with @S stiff??|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: not yet|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 5@C bid range too wide|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Vugraphzfc: martel always looks somewhat pained|pg||
nt|andyv:  you mean it doesn't show 6 card support...2 aces and an outside K, Al?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: frequently rubbing his eyes under his spectacles|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just doesn't seem to be convenient bid over 2@S to say	 it is our hand but i have 2 quick losers in @S|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Now Stansby's problem is that 5@c did not show values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs use Leaping Michaels over the Precision 2@C opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that would mean  Martel 4@D=@D & @H/@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  in 6@s, a @d lead and ruff if found will set it 2....otherwise a one trick set.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but	is that forcing or passable -- is it right with 6@S   etc|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Vugraphzfc: bramley pulls the tray through, turns his head slightly, examines his hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  I misspoke earlier about the price of 6@s...meant the vul wasn't right.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: a version i hadn't heard about before   (2@C)-?  4@C = @D & @H  4@D = @D & @S  [show @D and corresponding Major] |pg||
mb|6S|nt|Henryb:  I was about to say that bramley might take the successful save in 6@c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: bramley cocks his head, then a bit farther, then finds the green card|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  S knows a @c lead will get ruffed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: by at least one opponent|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I have not seen the construction where declarer needs to underruff himself at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this reminds me of Hamman-Wolff lead problem against slam in a world championship|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: IF  NS go on to 7@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 40 turned out to be a push as Zia found the pedestrian Q@s lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: bramley slight smile when the tray comes back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW must lead the suit that they have bid and raised to the heights -- normally a non-intuitive lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: then fights fleisher for the right to remove the tray from the table once bid cards are cleared|pg||
nt|andyv:  so the score on this board has changed for 420 to 920 to possibly 500 for NS|pg||
