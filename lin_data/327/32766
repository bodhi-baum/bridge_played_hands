nt|uni_dennis: @hA and @h ruff is only 4, so we need another one|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: www.jeugdbridge.nl for all tournament info|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@h could make on a @d lead as West never gets @sQ if declarer plays @s to the King|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|uni_dennis: but unlikely to get there|pg||
