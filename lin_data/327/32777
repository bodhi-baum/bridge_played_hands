mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: 3@S+2 looks to be a lot of tricks for me|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d!|nt|drorp: but NS did do well to stay on defense|pg||
nt|drorp: a heart contract could be brutal|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|drorp: same methods for the german pair as the israelis in the other room, i'm assuming double shows 5+ cards in a minor and a 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|drorp: takeout double from west seems appropriate, but not many people are agreed on all of these doubles in all of these situations, anyway now a decision for east if he's sitting for it ...|pg||
nt|drorp: or not|pg||
nt|drorp: north might preempt with 3@H here, which isnt unreasonable but not likely to do well when your entire hand is an ace (defense) and at these colours|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Atter explained, but I can't read it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: im sure he explained takeout|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: no, wrote down 3 lines|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|drorp: i think this will be 1 down for a push|pg||
nt|drorp: 3 trump tricks and 1 in any other suit|pg||
nt|drorp: north couldnt be happier to lay down this dummy in 2@H double by the way :) he might have invited to game on a free auction|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2N!|mb|3C|nt|drorp: weird that west passed 2N in the other room, probably same auction here, east might save in 5@C which is either 300 or 500 depending on the spade guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|drorp: spade guess should be easy, by the time you have to make it north will show AK@D and K@C and with 2 clubs in his hand no doubt he would double 1@C with the Q@S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: okay auction gets weird now :)|pg||
nt|drorp: north's bidding here, assuming he understands 2N as diamonds and hearts, is extremely timid|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe he will come to his senses now, there is no way that partner committed alone to the 3 level and you got AK and double fit in his suits and game isnt with some play|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|drorp: double was just a transfer to 4@C, and now he has to make a decision again|pg||

mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||

nt|drorp: 3N is okay with the Q@D onside|pg||

pc|c9|nt|vugraphzcp: Welcom Dror and Trian :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: sorry Traian|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|drorp: Israel came to amsterdam with their schools team strenghed by this NS pair, mainly for practice for our younger talents, so far they find themselves 2nd which is very good|pg||

nt|drorp: N didnt like to lead from this spade holding, so he chose something passive, hoping partner could later lead spades through|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|drorp: this defense works better than a spade lead, now declarer has only 8 top tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|drorp: heart discard may have finished defense hopes, although declearer still has problems, if he doesnt win A now he's down, defense will have tempo to establish a diamond trick|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|drorp: north can practically claim 1 down now|pg||
nt|drorp: a throw in with the 4th diamond is possible but since first declearer has to cash the winners from dummy he gets squeezed himself|pg||

nt|drorp: so if east does throw north in with the 4th diamond, north has to look carefully for the discards declarer made and know which suit to play|pg||
