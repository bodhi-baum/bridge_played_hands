nt|jkdood: Nunes popped A@C in the other room, and found a @H switch|pg||

nt|jkdood: Or now it looks like both down 2|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  an alternative would have been spade to dummy, then knock out the club....but Helness would be somewhat squeezed then|pg||

nt|jkdood: I see West has 6 tricks if he doesnt; will there be too much pressure to stop a 7th?|pg||
nt|passell: he knows partner has either the king or queen left|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: shuffling the A and 6 around|pg||

mb|5S|nt|ahollan1: only 3 swings this set  but for 38 imps|pg||
