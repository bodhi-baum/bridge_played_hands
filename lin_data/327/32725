mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: We see Gordon's style; not a weak 2@H bid for him, maybe for others|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|gab7nt:  I dont think any would open 2h as the hand has far too high an offense to defense ratio|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: And so he has a good hand for spades, not knowing his partner overcalled with just 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Welcome Gabrielle Sherman, hi|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  hi thanks|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  sorry i meant defense to offense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin asks pratap would he object if levin took the tray off the table, pratap said he'd get  it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: thank you!  , levin: nicehand!|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  an unlucky lead|pg||
nt|jkdood: SOme players say if you have a max, even if u overcalled missing a length, you should still cooperate. But Souths signoff is sensible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon: I  toldhim I had a nice hand.   levin: you certainly did|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jkdood: AFter all his partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin pauses.  pratap: no spades?|pg||

mb|1D!|an|1+|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: I didn't actually see Nick's pitch on the club Ace - assumed it was a diamond, but maybe it was a spade and he lost 2 diamonds|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|sixela: or maybe he asked if the q of s was on and then claimed 9 tricks...assuming 4-2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|lrobb98:  1NT is so tough to defend.....|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sixela: could they have played the 4th round of c instead of a second d?|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  NS play rightside up carding....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: That's possible - they played very fast and then claimed :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfb: And I haven't had my coffee yet :)|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  rightside up vs upside down..upside down, low encourages, high discourages...|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  they also play Rusinow vs NT, which is a good system, eliminates the quandry when partner leads the K vs NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: But the 4th club must be the right answer, because Nick just leaned over to Sonty and said - "I should have played my last club and pitched the second diamond to make 4"|pg||

nt|sixela: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: in his partnership with landen it might be a 1-bid|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jkdood: I think we all agree whole heartedly with P|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  i like a 1s opening it is often wise to bid light when vul v not in second seat|pg||

nt|jkdood: NS has some future is @S but may be hard to discern in time to play those|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin sees @CQ fall, asks pratap: are you trying?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: falsecard from  QT tight|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin closes the door  to our meeting  room|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|jkdood: I think down 1 is more likely than making, but its far from clear|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: suddenly very quiet/intimate in here|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|gab7nt:  a pretty boring hand it would surprise me if the defense gets this wrong|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jkdood: That club "misguess?" helps the down-1 (or more) pathway, a fine spade switch found|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  not much for stevie to do here |pg||
nt|gab7nt:  pretty grim choices|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein  fiddling with quitted tricks as is his habit|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  i suppose he can play a diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|lrobb98:  Over 3d interference, you dont have the room as easily...|pg||

nt|gab7nt:  well at trick one south should have given h count|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  i assume they play std carding?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: theydidn't mention it. pairs know each other.  will relay whatever I pick up|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfd: now we get to see that defense to 1NT levin was telling  gordon about|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin pulls up his chair|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  lets see how levin handles this|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  Imnot sure what they play here but such hands are rare and it's not clear what i would bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: bouncing slightly in it.  jeans, white t-shirt, glasses, wristwatch, purple sweatshirt wrappedaround his neck|pg||
nt|jkdood: 3@D has some merit 7-4- bid more?|pg||
mb|2D!|an|-> 2!H|nt|jkdood: NS may find it hard to locate their spade fit over such a call|pg||
nt|jkdood: 2@D will let spades in, to NS's benefit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein writes @D + major|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gab7nt:  yes 3d is a nice call bidding where he lives...but showing diamonds and a major certainly is a good call too|pg||
nt|jkdood: We see +140 in spades in the other room; looks to be the same here on the way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: then waves it off|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "we  treat this as weak, 2D=>@H"|pg||
nt|jkdood: Sontag bid 2N over !N in other room, NS still found spades and stopped... WD|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin sighs heavily|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  i am not sure i would want to stop short of game looking at these cards|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  they did well to stop|pg||
nt|jkdood: Katz and Nickell appear to have played transfers ON over that call, worked very well|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  as trumps break poorly which can be infered from opps bidding|pg||
mb|d|an|honor-third !H + ace|nt|gab7nt:  I assume the double here is pass or correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin writing out: 5 @H or 4 @H longer minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: North could certainly super-accept a transfer like Nickell-Katz, or raise a bid of 2@S here, to play, with extras|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  north certainly does not have a superaccept however he can compete as it is likely opps have a diamond fit|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  ah ok the double shows a decent hand to compete in hearts |pg||
mb|4D|an|natural|nt|jkdood: It is interesting in @S contract defense; East can get a @C ruff early, but that will allow NS to discard  their heart loser in time|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  wow nice call|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  by bobby|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  what nice bidding|pg||
nt|jkdood: I think Gordon will try 4@S now|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  he cannot possibly|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  bid 4s|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  he did not even bid 3s|pg||
nt|jkdood: The defense has to be careful to set it, if chosen|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  this should get passed out|pg||
nt|jkdood: Not that 4@S is a recommended call, but NV knowing something of his style, I am betting we will see it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: weinstein's writing is too small for me	to read.  levin's is clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jkdood: Now who is not a bit surprised by this 4@H call?|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  ah ok Stevie may have assumed Bobby must have a 4th h for his 4d call|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin's stack messed up coming through the curtain.  he tidiesit while gordon thinks|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  sorry a fifth h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon's arms crossed against his chest|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Some specs say they expected it; must trust their honesty :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  it is a great game|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  i mean the diamond rates|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  to be onside|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: "I showed 4 @H and  a longer minor. stevie showed honor-third of @H and an ace"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gab7nt:  stevie was most likely just giving bobby a choice of games|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap had asked: "am I allowed to know what you explained over there"|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gab7nt:  unlucky for ew|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  Pratap has the wrong cards|pg||

nt|gab7nt:  so an exciting hand that could have been a swing|pg||
nt|jkdood: Will just be 2 imps loss|pg||

nt|gab7nt:  it must feel awful to go for a number on a hand where it's not even clear game would make|pg||
nt|poohbear: or even bid|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  for sure|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  these past two hands offer lessons on the dangers of gratuitous bidding|pg||

nt|jkdood: I suppose -1100 is also lurking?|pg||
nt|jtmckee: quite a testimony :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|jkdood: EW can make a few spades...|pg||
mb|2D!|an|constructive 4-card raise|nt|jkdood: If NS bid to 4@H confidently, we could see a NV 4@S sac by East...|pg||
nt|meargent: indeed|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gab7nt:  a surprising 2d call |pg||
nt|gab7nt:  that hand is way more than just constructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|meargent: what i was thinking but am an old and slow thinker|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  it evaluates to 12 or so|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: 4@S doesn't do too badly either...|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: but it avoids the poor game :)|pg||

pc|cA|mc|11|nt|lrobb98:  X by W would have called for a spade lead, but the problem is W had nothing..he could get a spade lead and still not beat the contract....on this layout S would have probably then bid 4 spades.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm going back to put the play in right on board 1. The players have left and we'll be back soon|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  yes, on board 14, Levin(E) made a good bid, starting with a X, going after them....|pg||
nt|sixela: yes, most likely, and a x by w would be highly "imaginative", he can't beat 6|pg||

nt|poohbear: Levin wasnt going to misguess @ss after North has shown all that !|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin: sorry, cold contract|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  this hand would be more exciting with reversed colors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more joshing|pg||
nt|jkdood: Last board of this set; thanks to all the specs for coming and comments, and BBO and ACBL and Jan and team as well!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: levin said if he went up @CK pratap had to drop @CQ to beat it|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  can you imagine how much bidding would go on if ew were favorable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap said you know I'm a bridge professional part of the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and then they took off from there|pg||
nt|poohbear: Anyone make a TO dbl with East?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|meargent: easts in both room did well by passing|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  not facing a passed pard at these colors no|pg||
nt|poohbear: agree|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  i dont takeout light without shape when pard is passed|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: gordon not nearly as animated as these other three|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  south is figuring if slam is possible|pg||
nt|jkdood: Sontag passed 1@H also in the replay|pg||
nt|meargent: the bridge is alot more difficult for him to be at ease|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  I am not sure it can be better than a finesse in this auction|pg||
mb|4D|an|splinter|nt|gab7nt:  but he tries and north will accommodate with a h cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Helness did also in the other match (Monaco up by 27) I am told...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gab7nt:  they will see they are off key too many and stop in five which luckily makes as hearts behave so no ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  ah ok south signs off|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  wisely|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  he was worth one try|pg||
nt|poohbear: North should make another try over a signoff . What more can he have?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: again 4@d splinter 4@h cue 4@S signoff  and slow pass from weinstein|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  but not more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: not thinking, just trying to delay the tray a moment|pg||
nt|meargent: on lie of cards safe hand since 5 level ok|pg||
nt|poohbear: good tray control by Weinstein after the fast signoff|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  now north must ask aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: screen runs NW to SE diagonally across table.  so players do not see their partners' bids until tray passes through|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  and they will be lucy that the five level is safe|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: clock has just ticked over. director peeks in to checkour progress|pg||
nt|meargent: pratap has to play very carefully to make 10 trcks in @Ss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: intermission will be short since we are behind|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5 level not safe in @Hs on this board, in case one wanders to that spot... even 4@H fails|pg||
mb|4N|nt|gab7nt:  yes unlikely they will play in 5h|pg||
mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  south has no reason to do that|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|meargent: if pratap slips only slightly he will end up making 11|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  a bridge god just pointed out that some may have doubled 4H on the auction at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 5@D shows 1 - so gordon might have signed off more quickly|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|gab7nt:	for the lead... it requires just an ace|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  in parters hand|pg||
nt|jtmckee: thats that|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|poohbear: breakfast time. Restart in just a few mins|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  fascinating yes... I bet Marty Fleisher would have doubled it and he would be correct... he is so good with these doubles|pg||
pc|d6|mc|11|nt|gab7nt:	I suppose there is fear of opponents running to 4s but who cares that contract makes anyway and you wont set 4h without the ruff|pg||
nt|jkdood: And Katz might guess to pull 4@Hx to 4@S :)|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  then the double still does not cost|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: director says don't take too long because other match has  been waiting and need to restart at the same time|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  its a freebie|pg||
nt|meargent: and he might not|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that's all for now, see you all again shortly|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  thanks all|pg||
