nt|reisig: Steve's Pass is curious|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno:  Perhaps a relay to 3@c|pg||
nt|kareno:  I would surely have bid 2@d at least with Steve's hand|pg||
nt|jkdood: I doubt Stevo will sell to 3C in balance...|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno:  6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|jkdood: South has 6-5 as well :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: In the other room, EW did not bid at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: hushed discussing between S/W, can't pick up much of it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: weinstein: less than invitational?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Roy Welland held West's cards; surprisingly conservative there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: sadek leans forward and whispers with his back to me, no idea what he said|pg||
nt|kareno:  Welland can surprise you on either side of aggressive/passive|pg||
nt|kareno:  He has a good sniffer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: levin throws his glasses onto table, face in his palms, fingers in his hair|pg||
nt|jkdood: If he "guesses" 3@H now, I suspect the "other" 6-5 will try 3@S|pg||
nt|kareno:  3@h seems pretty risky to me.  3@d much more likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: first of 4 segments today.  second in about an hour, third set five hours from now|pg||
nt|jkdood: That would also "fetch" 3@S I think by S|pg||
mb|3D|nt|reisig: Karen wins again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno:  Give me that Coke!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: Only if you guess if S will sell here?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno:  So here 3@s would show 5-6 |pg||
nt|kareno:  That was clear :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: SOOO ..we settle in 4@c anyway :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: weinstein sighs, reaches for pass card, withdraws, passes|pg||
nt|jkdood: Bobby might take a chunk of 4@C? Nahhh.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: levin may have something to say about that|pg||
nt|reisig: NO WAY!|pg||
nt|kareno:  For the specs, note how important these part-score battles are.  Generally big team events go to the team which wins those battles.|pg||
nt|jkdood: North could guess to pass 3@S also|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jkdood: Or not!!!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: levin shakes his head at that|pg||
nt|reisig: Ooops|pg||
nt|kareno:  Oops - north forgot it was a PART SCORE battle.  |pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno:	This went from a push board to a sizeable loss in one moment.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: waso picks up his bid cards.  levin pushes tray through for him so other side knows the auction has ended|pg||
nt|jkdood: A likely 8 for the Nickell team|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jkdood: Yes specs down 2 possible, but may surprise us (that would be 12 imps)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jkdood: Although +130 in the other room is indeed aberrant, so 12 more likely than 8 for Nickell|pg||
nt|kareno:  The fact is that game is not unreasonable on these cards|pg||
nt|kareno:  Clubs 3-1 and spade onside is all it takes.|pg||
