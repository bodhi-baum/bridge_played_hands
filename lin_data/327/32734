nt|gab7nt:  it's not clear what the six would show if anything but my guess is|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  they either play smith or|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: sorry guys|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  north followed with his lowest heart|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: meckstroth: that's ok, take all the time you want|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  to encourage a club|pg||
nt|prospero1:  @h6 is a terrible card no matter their signals|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  i was not watching|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  so i cannot say|pg||
nt|meargent: 3nt is cold on the way the defence will go|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Did Gordon really play the @h6?|pg||

nt|meargent: im not wrong |pg||
nt|meargent: yet|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  here he pitches his lowest spade|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Gordon may not appreciate Pratap may have led from this holding|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: meckstroth: one more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: pratap: and the fun will be over|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Muddled because they had two tricks to spare. Often there's only one.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: for two hours or so.  restart 1900 CDT / 0000 GMT|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  yes but then you pay more attention to your spots hopefully|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  north could have been louder|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  going low is right here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|prospero1:  Precision pairs often do not have the option, but there is some evidence that opening 1@s is superior to 1N when balanced, but 1N better than 1@h|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gab7nt:  south had a sabine roy 1c opening (intending to rebid nt) :)|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Meckwell is paying attention to your partner's cards, so you better do as well, or just card randomly :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: that  was actually 10-8-3 but meckstroth in 4th position played the @s8 so I couldn't see|pg||
nt|prospero1:  1N opening clearly worked better than 1@s on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: do mybest with the spots  so you can read the  signals but won't bat 1.000|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  i tend to be overly loud and reliant on signals because im not a great thinker... many players can do well with little or no help but for sure the lowest heart would have helped out a ton|pg||

pc|c5|mc|8|nt|prospero1:  My judgment is that if you and your partner are roughly equal, you should card as best as you can at your level. If you are a pro playing with a client, you should probably card randomly a lot and get good at making judgments without signals|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  thanks all there is a break now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: ok, closing up. see you all in an hour 45|pg||
