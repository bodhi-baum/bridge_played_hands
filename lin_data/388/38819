mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|krhorneman:  2@c ruffs will see 5@h go off 4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Hurd deciding on a tactical approach, goes for the direct 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|krhorneman:  not clear that this is a forcing pass|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the usual question, is this a forcing auction, it seems NS treat it that way|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	well, they did find the correct game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if openers side bids a vul game voluntary, a force is on (one possible rule)|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	yes, for sure, the vulnerability important here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: no notes on auction|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	However, would it still be forcing if the bidding had been the same but North had bid 2@s instead of 3@c?  When the opponents have shown as good or better hands than your side, it isn't so clear|pg||
nt|fabsayc: against 5@H the defense could get 800, against 5@C only 300|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	whatever lead Joel settles on, the dummy's distribution will make a cash out easy|pg||
pc|c4|nt|shuster:  I see no reason why a passed hand opposite a 3rd seat opener would have a forcing pass unless the 3rd seat opener shows extra values en route to game|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|shuster:  had South called 4@D instead of 4@S, that would establish a FP|pg||
pc|cK|nt|krhorneman:  yes, I agree with that in principle, MIchael, though this is the one vulnerability where I might see an exception|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	your approach requires that South make a cue bid even with no slam interest just to set up a forcing pass, and	that has hazards of its own|pg||
nt|shuster:  the vulnerability doesn't change the cards in ones hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i agree is not clear in this case, was just stating the simplest version of the rule|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	but the vulnerability implies that South has extra values even if not cue bidding on the way, I would suggest|pg||
nt|shuster:  well, EW found a very good save, and the double will only hold the loss a little bit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	Yes, certainly West did well to find the right save|pg||
pc|s3|nt|shuster:  I think if North thought that pass was forcing, he probably would not have passed...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	you think he would have doubled?|pg||
nt|shuster:  So a very good start to the set for Ganzer|pg||
nt|shuster:  I'm getting some good messages about how playing in the weaker strain (clubs) has prevented club ruffs that would have been possible against hearts|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	at the other table, North bid 3@s over 2@c probably showing a mixed raise, and East didn't bid|pg||
nt|shuster:  When choosing between two strains, it is usually easier for the opponents to navigate a ruff in the suit in which they have the ace|pg||
nt|shuster:  so better to play in the suit MISSING the ace|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	I am a big fan of mixed raises, especially if they get us up quickly in the bidding, and this hand is one of the examples of why|pg||
nt|shuster:  I'm not sure why Wooldridge ducked the @CA, but I'm sure he had a good reason|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	I am also guessing that here, E/W had the agreement that as a passed hand 3@h was fit showing, even though not a jump, since at the 3 level.|pg||
nt|shuster:  but the play has tortured his partner a fair bit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not always easy to determine, but here brady has effectively shown heart ace, and only 5 probably since he was in second chair|pg||
nt|shuster:  there are fit showing jumps, which many players play and fit showing non jumps, which always risk disaster|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	Ganzer's bidding only makes sense to me if he knew he had a big @c fit, however|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	I suspect they have a specific agreement here|pg||
nt|shuster:  yes, Ganzer knew about the club fit, otherwise he would at least have bid 4NT to allow for hearts|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think Hurd might have disconnected.  Check his ping|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my ping is in sleep mode|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	Even with no agreement, 3@h would surely show at least tolerance, as East is a passed hand, but I feel sure that here it was fit showing in the bigger sense of being at least 54 in the suits|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: shuffling and reshuffling his cards|pg||
nt|shuster:  I wonder if he is thinking about trying to give partner a diamond ruff (playing partner for Kx in diamonds)|pg||
nt|shuster:  but then, what is the club situation?|pg||
nt|shuster:  why wouldn't declarer have already drawn the trump|pg||
pc|h9|nt|krhorneman:  he may think he needs to lead a @h|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|shuster:  as it turns out, nothing matters here|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	playing his pard for KJ and not wanting to set up a @d pitch|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	after all, he doesn't know about the double fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not entirely true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they do have to belatedly take their diamonds|pg||
nt|shuster:  yes, the need to eventually take their tricks|pg||

nt|shuster:  hate to leave AKQJx of hearts unbid|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	worked out well though, as game cannot be beaten here|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	and 3@h did not play well at the other table|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	West has given the defense the best chance by ducking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this duck by ganzer has hurd confused|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	South can counter by leading a @d back to the Queen, but how easy is that to find?|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	a @s to the board to lead a @c will be disastrous, assuming Rob works out which red ace Ganzer has, which hw can probably show by playing the 9 of @ss and not the jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are layouts where he could go down, for example west holding Ax in clubs and east four diamonds|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	hurds issue is that if a @d to the queen loses, he may have just created the entry to the @ss that he's trying to avoid, in the form of the @dJack|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	he has found the solution to cover for either defender having the @dAce|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what if brady returns club 10 now, it will surely scare hurd|pg||
nt|krhorneman:	I think rob's tempo will give it away|pg||
nt|shuster:  clubs have to be 7-1 or West would have led one and East would have a 6-card suit for an unfavorable 3 bid|pg||
