mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 5+@H, FG|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Woolsey overcalled a natural 1@C with 3@D|pg||
nt|dburn:  I think so too - Bramley may actually have made fewer errors, but incurred more "time faults"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me if one bid 1@D and another 3@D  it would be flip-flopped|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither player is thought of as a speed demon |pg||
mb|4C|nt|dburn:  tricky for Bramley, who has options...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 3@D from Cheek - Stansby has less of a chance to sell Bramley on @H being the right strain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming @H IS the best strain|pg||
nt|dburn:  ..he could even pass, but then he would not know what to do|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no comprende pass|pg||
nt|dburn:  strong club, positive response by West (I assume)? you could pass, to see what happened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D gave them more than enough room to maneuver -- pass only gives more|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: behind screen, who has paused?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  both pairs use 1@C-1@H to show any 8-11, not 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe pass is more preemptive than 1@D|pg||
nt|dburn:  after a 1@d overcall, they still play that way?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no  1@D allowed Stansby to make natural game forcing bid [5+@H]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: It is Cheek!|pg||

nt|dburn:  maybe partner would bid 3@s...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:	no, Cheek should bid|pg||
nt|dburn:  and so should Stansby, and so should Grue|pg||
nt|dburn:  but when they have all done that, Bramley might or might not pass|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dburn:  pick a grand slam|pg||
mb|6H|nt|ahollan1: way too deep for Bramley to pass 4@H - but i didn't see the void showing jump coming either|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: can't see a way for declarer to overcome the transportation and 4-1 trump break|pg||
