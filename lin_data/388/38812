nt|vugraphzfe: Woolsey shaking his head.|pg||
mb|3S|an|shortness|nt|ahollan1: over Jacoby  IF you have a choice of  showing  shortness or 2nd suit -- which do you show with north?|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: believe it or not - north's @C are TOO GOOD  to show 2nd suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 3@S my vote too|pg||
mb|p|nt|gosia: I agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was taught 4m just said good 2nd 5-card suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but with solid source of tricks, the bid endplays the 2N bidder|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike when you need help in the 5-card suit   -- then jump is very helpful|pg||
mb|4S|nt|gosia: wonder what pass of dbl means - I play it as interest in going on - Woolsey suggests the opposite |pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is:  encouraging, but not 1st round control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you do something different in your partnerships?|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|gosia: no kibbitzers or director to turn dummy ?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: kibitzers very rare in that scenario|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: small room, no one else here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: as Steve said -- kibitzer has no rights - even if taking over role of turning cards|pg||

nt|robinswr: kibizer's can turn cards but they can't say anything|pg||
nt|gosia: hey Stevie :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: lighting not great|pg||
nt|robinswr: pass would be forcing. double of 4@s would show a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was Steve answering my question about Cayne's options over 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Cayne long pause|pg||
