pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jcmax:  One idea with such a hand is playing partner for some points and wondering why he didn't bid over 1@d. that kind of thinking might get a minor suit lead. But it's certainly taking a view.|pg||

nt|jcmax:  Opposite 15-17 some players may make an invitational bid with the W hoping for the magic 17 or some other good thing to happen. I believe in the long run it is better fo one's imp score to stay low with a balanced 8 count.|pg||

pc|h6|nt|jcmax:  So what speaks for passing 2@D and what for bidding 2@H|pg||
nt|meargent: must admit i would have been hard pressed to pass north hand even over a 14 16 nt|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Presumably 2@D could be 54 either way.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would help to know agreement about which suit tends to be 5cards|pg||
nt|jcmax:  One way of thinking with the W hand is that one certainly doesn't want to get doubled.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: probably either way|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jcmax:  And it's always harder to penalty dbl 2@H than 2@D|pg||
nt|jcmax:  If 2h! makes it's a game.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close are you to bidding 2@S with Bramley's hand  [over 2@H after denying 5]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my thinking  maybe as little as swap @H & @D|pg||
nt|jcmax:  A kib mentions there is a chance partner has @S and then will bid over 2@H. That is certainly possible, but I would consider it unlikely looking at only 2@H|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not positive, but suspect DBL of 2@H would be penalty -- Cheek's 2@H was pass/correct and Grue's Major unknown|pg||
nt|meargent: bramley stayed consistent with his original pass usually a wise move|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Partner would have at most 3@H and the opponents at least an 8cd fit in @H wthout having bid them|pg||
