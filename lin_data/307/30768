nt|athene: Holland is trying to cater for @DKQx with east|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if you pass and remove partner's double it shows shortage in overcallers suit|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: he didn't want to go to dummy with a heart ruff *first* and take the finesse, because then west might win a singleton honour and give his partner a heart over-ruff|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another good board for n-s, i think this will be tougher to flatten at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: It was Simpson who was thinking|pg||
