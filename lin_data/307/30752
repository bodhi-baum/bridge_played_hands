nt|athene: of course if declarer leads a trump and west plays a low one, he has to decide whether to finesse the 7|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it's the percentage play|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative is to just lead to the @CJ; then if the @C9 falls, you can set up a spade trick, and if not, you run the trumps and hope for an endplay|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dK|pc|cQ|pc|s2|nt|athene: i would have thought it was simpler to just play for the @C9 onside - if it is, you lead the @SK throwing a red-suit loser and you are ok even if west has the @SA|pg||

nt|athene: if north covered the @SJ now it would make 13, as you have enough entries to ruff two more clubs then draw trumps|pg||
