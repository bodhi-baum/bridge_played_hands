mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: you would think that is either 3 spades or a weak notrump - but here King has both and he still didn't bid it, so i don't know :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|athene: maybe it's 3 spades unbalanced|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: maybe we start with @HAK, heart ruff, diamond to ace, fourth heart ruffed to kill the pitch on the @HQ|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|athene: that is one possible line of defence but not really necessary - declarer can't get to dummy, draw trumps, then get back to pitch on the heart anyway|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: now declarer can unblock @CQJ, come to @SA and run the trumps, and north has to throw his @SK to avoid getting endplayed|pg||

nt|broze:  If a player would open 2S at red, then often thye will open 3 at w/r|pg||
nt|broze:  South deems it appropriate here even with the 6332 shape|pg||
nt|broze:  West considering 3NT or pass, hoping for partner to reopen with dbl|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|broze:  3NT covers a huge range of hands so Green's 4D surprised me.|pg||

nt|broze:  6 of either Major here|pg||
nt|broze:  7 @H is excellent.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  i know odd things happen but this is easy to bid - but 7@H is only on for3-2 break|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|roswolf:  in practice|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|7H|nt|roswolf:  south uses the blackwood cannon -very much in character|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|roswolf:  and fortune favours the brave|pg||
nt|broze:  If you are sure that the other table are playing a small slam you need a Major suit grand slam to be at least 56% to make it a good bet.|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: Kendrick says that partner may need a king|pg||
nt|roswolf:  a @D lead may have caused some difficulties|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: Mestel puts his cards on the table and has a think|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|athene: in 7@H you can throw a diamond on the long spade so you don't need the diamond finesse|pg||

nt|athene: if north ever shows four hearts then of course south will see the advantage of playing there|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely north will just show max/min 3/4 spades, balanced/shortage|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is legal to tap your pass card, or borrow opps pass card right?	(joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: or just move it from earlier bidding |pg||
