pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|pdjourdain:  Getting interesting now as clearing the club means a third diamond gives him 8 tricks with the spade finesse|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	He might try spade queen first to see if north covers|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	If so, set up hearts, if not set up clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: still tricks to lose though|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	But the defence have only two hearts and two clubs to cash at the moment|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pdjourdain:  North would have covered the queen and south would exit with a third heart|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	so it looks as if the club misguess was fatal|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	I think forrester feared that playing on hearts needed the nine to come down in three and gave a tempo to the defence|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	We are told there is an exposed penalty card from south|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but how does 33 hearts or doubleton 9 compare percentage-wise with clubs providing four tircks?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	The director will be called but Zia has the spade eight exposed early|pg||

nt|pelu:  so a very bad and a small +board for Sinclair in the !bag".|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room must be VERY slow|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Allfrey still has board 23 to come though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: per web page    score after 2 segments   Sinclair 32   Allfrey 28	    we may have that many imps exchanged in this set of 8 |pg||
nt|pelu:  a very good 6@c - or 6NT - only problem @cJ xxx on wrong hand |pg||
nt|pitiful:  6N much better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1N = 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu:  NS Has slamvalues so I exp NS in 6NT or 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|ahollan1: from 2013 CC   2@S = a) BAL, INV  b) @C/@D, INV  c) @C & @D, FG|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  2@s could be transfer to @c and S can now show good values in @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume  2N = reject BAL INV|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  initially either invite with no 4M as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  S can get some count, but I dont expect that he will finess @cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just guessing, that 2@S could also include the hand that would normally bid 1N-4N, but that hand would probably rebid 3N |pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  tough decision for south now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think  3@C = @D	a) weak  b) FG|pg||
nt|pitiful:  3@h looks like it is solid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:	Sabine mightdouble this on the way out|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  3@h maybe only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Roy's body language is of a troubled man|pg||
nt|pelu:  very close to 5 losers in 3@h|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west is not expecting partner to have these good @s for a weak jump in @d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many tricks in @s peter?|pg||
nt|pelu:  still counting :):)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no fair -- i was just typing that|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Robson chomps on a biscuit courteously provided by the English Bridge Union, whose premier event we are watching  here this evening|pg||
nt|pelu:  also close to 8|pg||
nt|pitiful:  go on then al|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  i could see west making 9 in @h if defence not perfect|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pitiful:  so Alex allfrey will ruff and play a @d I guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will he need to play Welland for @CJ?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|pelu:  1 entry in dummy and then N has to run @c10|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  well quite likely to have Jack @c on the bidding but easy to see from here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Auken options seem to be @C8 ad @SQ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d by west maybe suit preference|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if he has more than 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he had a lot of choices in @H at trick 1|pg||
nt|pelu:  sorry @DK and @s is entry to play up @cs 2x|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes Al, 3@h was sp |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think more likely @D2 = reverse count|pg||
nt|pelu:  so 2@ss + @dA + @cA for EW|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|pelu:  = 730 for NS |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
