nt|kareno: But a 4th seat weak 2 can certainly be an opening bid in standard methods|pg||

nt|capt_aa:  fair hand|pg||
nt|kareno: From a spec:  west and east play a souped up Polish Club, Kuzkin and Campbell|pg||

nt|capt_aa:  may well regret not open as 4S appears a make N/S|pg||

They won this event in 2010 and last year in 2013. They play precision. |pg||
nt|dannymiles:  I will occasionally refer to them as "The Gartagani" (one Gartaganis, two Gartagani)|pg||
nt|dannymiles:  Shan has never won the CNTC but surely that will change before long...he has a 2nd place finish in an NABC event and I believe made the round of 8 in the Spingold or Vanderbilt.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=1930|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dannymiles:  David Sabourin and Shan Huang are the two youngest members of team Zambonini. They are both professional bridge players. Shan in fact is still eligible for juniors at age 24! David has won the CNTC once, in 2007 I believe.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|dannymiles:  Huang opens 1@d to prepare for a convenient rebid over a likely 1@s response...over a 1C opener he would have to rebid 1NT with a singleton spade or repeat the clubs (yuck) with only A98xx|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|dannymiles:  Interesting....Huang takes the push to 3@c in front of his partner on a potential misfit deal....in this case, Sabourin surely would've competed to 3@c anyway|pg||
