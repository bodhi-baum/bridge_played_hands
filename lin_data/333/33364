nt|ahollan1: Sinclair only played 24 boards in SemiFinal  then their opponents down 32	w/d|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Allfrey had to play 40 boards!	an extra set because of conditions of contest|pg||
nt|ady: what happened to the 10th trick last hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+	IF balanced, then can have ANY 5-card suit and many  (542)2@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: welcome back Patrick|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: 1N forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|pdjourdain:  Here 2@H making is normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = a) 4+@D  b) BAL, (11)12-13 HCP|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	and @Ds are 3-3|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:	well, it is normal to make 2@H - it is not necessarily normal to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  Only 3 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: whether you play hearts or not depends how forcing your 1NT is, i think|pg||
nt|athene: non-forcing, semi-forcing you will play 1nt|pg||
nt|dburn:  at the other table, where 1NT was "normal" (i.e. not forcing) it became the final contract|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	declarer needs a club ruf and four @Ds|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: 3rd/5th lead :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  and although a "normal" club lead would have beaten it, these days it is considered "abnormal" to lead fourth best from longest against 1NT - instead, you are supposed to lead passively|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: does initial trump lead beat 4@H? or can declarer do something with spades to make up for his missing club ruff?|pg||

mb|p|mb|r!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|pdjourdain:  But they must have the method to find their fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think system is on   so 2@C = Puppet to 2@D  for various hands|pg||
nt|athene: does anyone know the significance of west's second-round pass? might be showing club stop, or perhaps a bid there showed a 5-card suit?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i can only guess about PASS by looking at his hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: some top pairs have quite complex agreements in these situations, so that if responder is the one with the club stop, he plays the major-suit contracts to protect his hand on ...|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:	so happy now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|pdjourdain:  He can throw a diamond on the club but still only makes 10|pg||
nt|athene: forrester's line of defence pretty much guaranteed the trumps were breaking|pg||
nt|athene: he was clearly trying to give his partner a club ruff and get a diamond ruff in return, which he wouldn't be aiming for if either defender had a singleton trump|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	As he has only one trump for the two losers|pg||

nt|athene: it could be @D107 or something playing upside down|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	That leaves Allfrey needing 18 imps from Boards 29 and 30|pg||
nt|athene: then diamond ruff, club ruff ends things immediately|pg||
nt|athene: west could easily have four diamonds on the bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up interesting question -- with @DQ and length in dummy -- should you revert back to standard carding when normally udca??|pg||
nt|athene: why would you want to do that?|pg||
nt|athene: if you are signalling length, aren't standard and upside down ambiguous equally often?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bridgewinners  "In the Well" with Eric Rodwell last month	he talked about when meckwell revert back to standard signals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure wish i could remember when & why|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Allfrey also had a close match beating the Celtic Fringe by only 3 imps in the once defeated|pg||
