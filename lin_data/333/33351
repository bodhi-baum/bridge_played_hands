nt|pelu:  here 9-5, sinclair - Lavazza 14-2 after the first 8 boards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: If both minors break, she does not need the @s finesse|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf:	the wrong lead was found|pg||
nt|athene: if the operator relayed things accurately in the other room, declarer there took a most peculiar line in 6nt|pg||
nt|athene: she won the heart lead and led the @DJ from her hand|pg||
nt|athene: east won and shifted to a spade and she finessed|pg||
nt|pelu:  but NS lost the board here by passsing to 5@h|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf:	i think this may well be flat since avoiding the slam here will be difficult|pg||
nt|athene: i think Hinden is lucky the cards lie so poorly; 6NT is going to go down on any line|pg||
nt|pelu:  6NT is a very fair contract but all 3 keycards wrong: @sK, @dK and @cj - and @ss 4-2 no 10 propping|pg||
nt|athene: i can't believe her line was best|pg||
nt|athene: go for spades looks natural; the problem is that if you start with spade to queen which wins, then cash the ace, you don't know whether to play another one or not|pg||
nt|roswolf:  has north actually showed a 21hcp hand - i doubt it|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pelu:  same bidding in CR and here S now bid 4NT|pg||
nt|athene: if you play another one you are home when they are 3-3 but down immediately when they aren't; no chance to try another suit|pg||

mb|5N|nt|pelu:	now 6NT looks easy to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  wrong - again :)|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|athene: well, north is essentially bidding 6nt|pg||
nt|roswolf:  5nt =pass the buck bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  therev will now be a lot of huffing and puffing|pg||
nt|athene: on a heart lead i think spade to queen looks the obvious start|pg||
nt|athene: but of course if that loses and a diamond comes back you can't combine your chances|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf:  hinden will have a substantial lead going in to the next half |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: interesting @HJ|pg||
nt|athene: normally you play lowest from touching in third|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: is he just falsecarding on general principles|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf:  16 bds to go but hinden has the 4right to have an extra 8 bds if behind at the end|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: or trying to show spade strength?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf:  this is a double elimination event and hinden were the undefeated team|pg||
nt|athene: ok, play going as described|pg||
nt|athene: so now if spades aren't running but the @DK is on, you should finesse...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: there are many considerations here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|pelu:  now down 2 if N take @dA - and thats the best chance for making|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|athene: yes, i think spades 3-3 or @S10x is what you go for at that point|pg||
nt|roswolf:  no lunch break so restart will be in 5-10 mins approx|pg||
mc|9|nt|pelu:  but down 1 in OP could be a misscore - possible also down 2 there|pg||
nt|roswolf:  bye for now|pg||
nt|athene: one issue to consider is: what spade holding would make west most likely to duck the queen?|pg||
nt|athene: for example suppose he had @SKxx|pg||
nt|athene: he knows you have a singleton|pg||
