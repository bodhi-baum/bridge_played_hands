mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2D|nt|athene: 3@C from Allfrey of course|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3N|nt|ady: diamond part score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|ady: hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: here we have a good example of why you need fast side tricks for this sort of 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: you have one stopper in opps' suit, and a long suit of your own|pg||
nt|athene: you need something like a side AK or AA|pg||
nt|athene: a bundle of kings, queens and jacks are not getting the job done|pg||
nt|ady: one north opens 1 level bid  difficult to stop south from going to game|pg||
nt|DaveB:  might have hoped that N has an opening bid|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know if north had available the option of a weak-2@D|pg||
nt|athene: i would guess not|pg||
nt|dburn:  hard to blame South - North sometimes has an opening bid when she opens the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn:  not often, true|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Surely had the option of "Pass"?|pg||
nt|athene: i would open 2@D if that were available|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: if not, i would choose between 1@D and 3@D|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: pass is possible, but the green cards are so well-camoflauged by the baize table, they are so hard to find in the heat of battle|pg||

nt|athene: 3@C pass pass to north - now 3nt to protect @CAQ, or double to find major-suit contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  likely to be in game    either 3NT  or 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: apologies for the delay at the start. struggling to find a usable set of boards. OK now|pg||
nt|athene: of course, very aggressive pre-empters might not like to open 3@C with east|pg||
nt|DaveB:  E hand too good for fav vul preempt?|pg||
nt|athene: as it is at least three tricks more than their minimum|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  may scramble home even on bad diamond split  |pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: all ready for play again. a spec expresses surprise that we are in England and it is not raining. Hmmm...|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1D|mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|athene: hahaha|pg||
nt|athene: everyone has something to say|pg||
nt|athene: and north is looking at all that|pg||
nt|ady: hand 33   Allfrey gained 5 imps stopping in part score of 3@D|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: when you double a 1@H transfer are you showing hearts, or making a t/o double of spades?|pg||
nt|athene: the two things are often the same but it's useful to discuss|pg||
nt|dburn:  since a takeout double of spades will include hearts, yes|pg||
nt|athene: for example after (1NT ) pass (2@H) double, is that showing a t/o double of spades, or a 2@H overcall? not exactly the same hands|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: spec asks if Lavazza conceded 32 down with 8 to play. Yes, they did. Madame L had already flown home|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn:  crikey|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:	Allfrey's pair went for 500 the hard way at the other table - this may be 500 the normal way|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: what would 2@D over 1@C have shown for Osborne?|pg||
nt|athene: do they play that as majors?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: no, 2@c would be MM with them, I'm fairly sure. Cant see the CC, though |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: a weak jump overcall of 2@D looks like a perfect description of the south hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: interesting decision from Robson to leave 4@CX rather than correcting to spades (i assume 1@S showed three spades)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: many would go back to spades but 4@SX is not going to play well at all|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||

nt|athene: opening a 9-count with a 7-card minor worked out so badly for east last hand, south feels compelled to show him how it's done|pg||

nt|athene: lots of 5422, 6322s go in there|pg||
nt|athene: solves your rebid problems, gets you to games, makes life easier|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|ady: what does dbl mean?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: if 3@D were purely a pre-empt (like a 3@D opener) then you would expect double to be penalty|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they play all doubles up until 4 level as action|pg||
nt|athene: but my guess is that east has no other way to show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: sorry, no double, will correct|pg||
nt|athene: so 3@D might be more like a "normal" 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|athene: so perhaps you need double as more consultative|pg||
