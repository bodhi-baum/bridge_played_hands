mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: It's been a while since I lived and played in Canada (Toronto) and I don't know most of the players now.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kareno: 3nt would have been the preferred contract with eight top tricks and a ninth in spades.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Interesting first board...E/W miss 3NT which single dummy is a favourite; needing 4 spade tricks, or clubs 4-4 or the heart ace in the hand with 5 clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: And I think Sam Nystro should have at least tried it with only three diamonds|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|dannymiles:  Todd and Fisher are very steady players from Winnipeg (my original home town). They employ 12-15 notrumps and multi 2@d|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|kareno: My style would have been to jump to 2nt as west.  Balanced with the right hcp.  But I am sympathetic with his approach if he feels he needs a club stop for that bid.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Sam now lives in Toronto, originally from Vancouver, playing with west coasters Gray McMullen, Brian Maksymetz, Rock Shi Yan and from Saskatchewan, Tom Walsh|pg||
nt|Harmon: Hi all|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Todd's team is Todd/Fisher, Thunder Bay players Don Domansky and Dave McLellan, Winnipegger Neil Kimelman and Vancouverite Brad Bart|pg||

Perennial contenders in this event. Neither has won it before; they've come 2nd and 3/4 many times|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dannymiles:  Domansky/McLennan from Thunder Bay. There's a group of players in Thunder Bay who I claim are vastly underrated by the rest of Canada.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  Bart/Kimelman. Brad Bart from Vancouver I will confess taught me everything I know about bridge 20 years ago. Neil Kimelman is a solid player and author from Winnipeg. This partnership is less than 2 years old. They have also never won the CNTC|pg||
nt|kareno: Danny I once won a Regional at Thunder Bay - I know they have an active bridge community|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dannymiles:  Often you'd see one team from Thunder Bay at a decent sized regional such as Toronto (in the old days)...you'd think, "easy pickings". It was...for them!|pg||
