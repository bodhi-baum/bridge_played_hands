mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: 6@H a very good spot, and unlikely to reach 7 missing a keycard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then he makes if sttiff king OR if N has Kx and only 3 hearts|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: interesting choice for Forrester now, a simple 3@h leaving room or 4@D splinter - I would choose 3@H I think as 4@D leaves no room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gold worth a try even opposite a splinter|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: but perhaps he has some other tools in his armoury|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|nt|marlowepi: to overcome the problem of "no room", you can play 4D	over 2H as an "omni" sort of splinter, guarantee controls in the  2 off-suits as well|pg||

nt|marlowepi: many would hesitate to bid 1N with the S hand holding only Txx, but it has more going for it than other choices|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it gets the general nature of the hand across, and still leaves plenty of time to get out of NT when you dont belong there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: assuming of course that N share your creed about how to treat such hands|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Is J lead systemic do you know?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also if EW had all of the @S honors  they would have been bidding earlier and/or more|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Sort of Rusinow type?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: playing with screens here, so it slows eveything down as Tony F writes a question for Roy W|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: Roy whispers the answer, though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the old days literacy was not a requirement for top-level bridge|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: that is surprising that Welland would whisper rather than write |pg||

mb|1C|an|may be 2|nt|marlowepi: the english team :)|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Gold will surely overcall 1@S |pg||
nt|marlowepi: if breathing|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: (been wrong before)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|CopeyJ: 3NT is the contract, preferably by W|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+,  IF BAL can have ANY 5-card suit|pg||
mb|2D|an|!h|nt|marlowepi: there are dangers, but if LHO is about to bid NT, you have to get it in there|pg||
mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: is X showing @C, Al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = ostensibly transfer to NT|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Forrester using an increasingly popular treatment, transfers after a 1M overcall from partner and X from RHO|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but covers some other hands too|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C-(1@S)-1N = @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some people play those transfers over a minor by partner as well|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: and many play that whenever our side's first entry into an auction is 1M, and next hands doubles, transfers are on|pg||
mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: expect 3@h from Auken now if she has the chance, to suggest @h cover and worry about @s perhaps?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: old source for NS  says   after 1@C=<3	1@S was artificial   so obviously i need new chunk of info|pg||
mb|3N|nt|CopeyJ: and I guess Welland will try 3N - JX@S is good enough from partner|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|CopeyJ: Al - is it possible that their wonky defence to 1@C is only if favourable? Thaat vaguely rings a bell|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and the lack of a raise plus the 4-card length makes it highly probab;e that spades will not run  for the defense off the top|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: thoughful try by S|pg||

pc|s5|nt|CopeyJ: Old friends Zia and Robson are on opposing sides at the table next door|pg||
nt|vugraphzfp: long think before Gold's @d7. Welland not impressed, I think|pg||
