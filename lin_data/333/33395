nt|kareno: Hi again!|pg||
nt|kareno: Nick and Judy Gartaganis are a very strong pair.  You know the others, I assume?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kareno: I assume the IMP scores are correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  81-48 for EW (Gartaganis)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  I think we are having computer troubles (there are results showing already)...I believe the IMP scores are incorrect. http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/14files/BWeek14_CNTAsf.shtml 81-48 Gartaganis|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|kareno: I don't know the personnel (soon to	be announced) or their systems.  Obviously this is not a 'normal' weak 2|pg||
nt|kareno: But a 4th seat weak 2 can certainly be an opening bid in standard methods|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  balancing 2H..shows a fir hand...I am a bit surprized North did not open here...|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  fair hand|pg||
nt|kareno: From a spec:  west and east play a souped up Polish Club, Kuzkin and Campbell|pg||
nt|kareno: It certainly is a surprise to see north passing first seat.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  may well regret not open as 4S appears a make N/S|pg||
nt|kareno: Now it is possible that this auction happened before the reporter could begin and that 2@h is just the final contract.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  maybe not..  club loser in the wash it appears|pg||
nt|kareno: Perhaps the auction started in north 1@d - p - 1@s - 2@h and all pass?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|capt_aa:  1d..p..1S...2H...support dbl if that is agreement|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Danny|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  The ealier segment had problems with vugraph..hopefully this one will be troublle free folks|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Also, I strongly suspect that it is not Jurek and Zambonini playing as I believe they played both the 1st and 2nd segments and I would expect them to be on the sidelines for the remainder. But I could be wrong, perhaps they sat out the 2nd seg..|pg||
nt|kareno: So are we having similar or new problems?  This has been a weird day.|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  not an easy opening lead choice for South here..	but I expect a Major|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Look at the results tab, already showing 20-6 for NS. As soon as we clear this away, we are good to go|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	The correct score is 81-48|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kareno: So do we know if n/s actually played 4@s undoubled?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt a good practical bid by west|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	As suspected, Zambonini and Jurek are out...tho I do suspect NS are not Shan and Darren. Either Shan and David Sabourin or Dan Korbel & Darren Wolpert...they would not break up the partnerships at this stage|pg||
nt|kareno: Not unless there was some acrimony|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  good lead..Nick likely to go to dummy for heart lead to protect spade holding here|pg||
nt|danmathies:	likely d and d|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Very unlikely to be acrimony at this stage|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: info|pg||
nt|kareno: Lots of points but no communication.  Can't see nine tricks|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  If there is 9..My money on Nick to find them|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I anticipate a club to dummy to play a heart...but yes, Nick is an excellent declarer|pg||
nt|kareno: Three more spades to lose if south gets the lead.  And the other suits aren't cooperating|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  looks like Shan might gbet endplayed to lead club in ending .. one line to 9|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	He may play for diamonds 3-3 and the heart king onside|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Shan is a very youg pro...still able to compete in Juniors...  age 24 I believe|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Indeed. I'm sure most of us remember 1989 like it was yesterday...that was the year Shan was born|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  a sorry reminder!|pg||
mc|8|nt|kareno: Best I could see is eight|pg||
nt|danmathies:	cntc in ottawa that year|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I'm wondering operator/Gordon if we can clear the results tab and start fresh?|pg||

nt|kareno: Okay, now we'll see the real auction |pg||
nt|kareno: Folks there have been problems all day with wrong hands in our system versus at the table.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Um... maybe.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kareno: Ah, now this looks more normal|pg||
mb|1S|nt|capt_aa:  yes|pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: That's not possible.  Must be three passes before this 1@h by north or the cards are not right|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  I believe we are seeing 1H by North..  2S overcall|pg||
nt|kareno: We have the auction and a result and I assume we'll get caught up soon.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	http://www.cbf.ca/BWeek/14files/BWeek14_CNTAsf.shtml|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	For the scorelines|pg||
nt|kareno: At least we will see some good bridge played and learn the results later.  Hope for the best tomorrow.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: North may have opened out of turn... I've asked the reporter what's going on.|pg||
nt|kareno: GORDON CAMPBELL can you explain this?|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  East is dealer bd 2//so I assume you got it right Karen..3 passes to North 1H|pg||
nt|kareno: GORDON this cannot be correct.  |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  We are not on-site folks..do not see the mixup |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Look to be 1H by North..possibly out of turn?|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  East is dealer bd 2|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Well if North opened 1@c I'm going to guess this is Shan and David Sabourin sitting N/S respectively|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s playing strong club|pg||
nt|kareno: dbl showing values |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Korbel/Wolpert play "junior standard" which is 2/1 with gadgets|pg||
nt|kareno: Gordon, any chance to change the name on South?|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Dbl here is probablyh some 5-8 limit type message..  |pg||
nt|kareno: 3nt looks likely as a final contract|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  or possibly 4H...|pg||
nt|kareno: Or that north passed.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Potentially...North may bang down the @HAK and fall a trick short|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Playing a strong club system....or any system...North must bid hearts|pg||
mb|1N|nt|capt_aa:  seems doubtful that the dbl was penalty here?|pg||
nt|kareno: The score is not correct.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Either will make easily|pg||
nt|kareno: Here's a surprise - 1@s doubled nv - they need a lot of tricks to compensate for a 600+ game|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems more likely if he's a careful player that he'll start low to the ten for an eventual safety play|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: North concerned about spade ruffs in hearts|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Strange to chose the nt over hearts unless South has suggested something in spades|pg||
nt|kareno: Stella is in my lap and says hello to all her friends out there|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Lineups are correct now....Shan/David NS here with Korbel/Wolpert EW other table. Kor/Wolpert are fast players..they are on board 5 already!|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  club lead might kill this|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  nice lead Judy|pg||
nt|kareno: We know the movie is incorrect.  We're just showing the play for you and may have some comparisons as we go along|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Club lead would be the ripper. What's that about leading 3 and 5 card suits vs 3NT instead of 4 card suits? Well done Judy|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  the club "3" was upside down attitude...screaming :"keep them coming" |pg||
nt|kareno: Great lead!|pg||
mc|8|nt|capt_aa:  look s like Shan will ahve to hope for 3-2 hearts...	 not to be!|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Now he cannot make the hand....as long as Nick splits his heart honours, which he of course will|pg||

nt|kareno: Now he needed hearts to break -no such luck|pg||
mb|3C|nt|capt_aa:  Pity we are not able to follow play |pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: 5@c my choice by n|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Excitement here...I love these hands...IMO at the high levels of bridge, these are the hands that go a long way to deciding knockout match winners|pg||
nt|kareno: And in mine, it is the partscore hands that determine the winners - they add up quickly and the team that wins the most of them, generally, wins.  |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	EW can make 7@h or 7@d with the aid of a finesse. I also like 5@c by north. No need to get cute. Make them guess whether they have a slam or not right now|pg||
mb|5C|nt|kareno: These are exciting of course.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|kareno: In this room?|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  other room|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Judy is hot tonight...  |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	True Karen, the IMP scale does put more weight on the partscore battles. It's important to have good competitive methods and judgement on those deals much like these deals|pg||
nt|kareno: I play 'mad leaps to slam bar partner.'|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: This isn't right eithr.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	If Shan decides to save in 7@c, he goes for 1400, same score basically|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	WOW!|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  bids them like he sees them!!|pg||
nt|kareno: I would not have bid 7.  As it turns out (no surprise) there is a hole in the diamond suit.	WHAT IF EAST DIDNT HAVE THE JACK?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|dannymiles:  "No fear" Nick! I guess he figured partner had to have long strong hearts and the diamond Ace, counting on another piece here or there like doubleton diamond with club void, spade queen, etc|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  Play will not take long|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kareno: No|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Surely not. That's probably trick 2|pg||

pc|h2|pc|c2|pc|hA|mc|13|nt|kareno: I assume the auction started with pass pass 1@c|pg||

mb|2S|nt|dannymiles:  Very well done Nick and Judy. I like Shan's 5@c bid. If each opponent has a little extra and can make a slam, they are likely to languish at the 5-level. Won't console him much as he writes down -2210 on his scorepad|pg||
nt|kareno: If he hadn't bid it, they would have gotten to 7 much more easily|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|kareno: Do they play any sort of Lebensohl here if you know?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: capt_aa, say hello to the room :)|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Indeed.  It appears as we're going along, that we are getting correct results from the closed room|pg||
nt|kareno: Evidently yes but why wouldn't Sabo bid diamonds?|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Let me rephrase...I believe the results tab is correct for *the boards we have played here thusfar*, so up to board 3|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  not too many needed dummy entries..|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Notice after board 3, it is still old results from both rooms|pg||
nt|kareno: They did well in the CR to go down only 1 - I can't see how.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Not sure I like 2NT, prefer double or pass. I think it's hard to pass though against a precision pair who could be robbing you blind|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  I like dbl..then 2NT! by north to settle in a diamond fit here|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	But if partner is broke, it will get ugly and a suit contract rates to play better|pg||
nt|kareno: Ah, south bid 2nt.  I prefer double or pass also.  I was thinking he doubled and then north bid 2nt |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	By my calculations, the score is currently Gart 100, zambo 51. Ignore the IMPs on the results tab from boards 4 onward (til we play them)|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  for those of you confused with score..    just add scores for first 3 hands.. and comput ...going in 81-48 for Gartaganus (33)|pg||

nt|kareno: Not sure we can continue.  I've notiifed someone at BBO.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I like having either a very weak 5 card major, or a strong running 5 card major, when opening 1NT with a 5 card major. With an intermediate suit, I prefer opening the major as we'll likely need time to develop tricks in NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Agreed Danny.  My general feeling is that if your hand is balanced with nt range of points, then open it nt.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  If you have an ok rebid, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|capt_aa:  5C or 4S will fail if that is Shan's contemplation|pg||

nt|vugraphzbc: no|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	That *should* send 5 IMPs Nick and Judy's way but I do not trust the other room's result of playing in 2D. Although maybe they overcalled 1@h with 2@d and it went all pass?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|dannymiles:  Hmmm if only W and N were partners, against E and S, this would be a more exciting hand!|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: State of the match I might double as north|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Sabourin I'm betting will lead a trump, which looks best for the defense (as usual when the opponent shows 2 suits)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|capt_aa:  Light on points to reach a game...  |pg||
nt|po-s: well...|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I mgiht've doubled with Shan's hand as well, but...I'm guessing he didn't want to hang his partner who was likely very light, holding the majors white vs red (they play precision and light openers)|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Dan Korbel offered me the best advice. When opponents have a 2 suited auction, or a misfit auction like 1@d-1@s-2@c-all pass, don't even look at your hand. Lead a trump. Even when you think you have a clear alternative. Lead a trump. |pg||
nt|capt_aa:  spade lead not the best here...gives Judy chances..here clubs spots might lead to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|capt_aa:  similarly to leading a trumps agaains mini Roman auctions..where a coross ruff is coming|pg||
nt|kareno: Even if you give up a trump trick, it almost always comes back, often with interest|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
