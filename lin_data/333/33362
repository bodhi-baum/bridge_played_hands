nt|ahollan1: 2@H rather than 2@S rebid probably not everyone's choice|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|pdjourdain:  Start of match delayed when Hinden exercised right to extra 8 boards in semifinal|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|ahollan1: and Sinclair only had to play 3 of 4 segments when Lavazza early w/d|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Six spades poor odds but sucessful on spade king falling|pg||

nt|ahollan1: singleton K [real and imaginary]  played a role in a few 1st stanza hands |pg||

mb|5C|nt|pdjourdain:  Maybe "two-up" transfers at 4 level|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: after 2@D response -	"transfer" doesn't make strong hand declarer, so can just jump to 5@D with no slam interest|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:	I was surprised when it showed north had passed!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: and rather than running score, table was opened with 2-imp "carryover" from 1st set|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this could be bloody|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|d|mb|1D|an|!h|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: double was dangerous but on the layout far less perilous than 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in truth, at these colours facing a passed partner, there is a lot to be said for pass over 1C|pg||
nt|pitiful:  1@h=3@h up to poor 16|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:	At least three down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McIntosh DBL rather than 1N???|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pdjourdain:  This half time and a short break while they score up and can change line-ups|pg||
