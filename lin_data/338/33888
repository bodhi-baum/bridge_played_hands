nt|bt:  a case can be made for not showing that @H "suit" but 3nt is likely down as well|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: http://tinyurl.com/lu4g97r for running scores|pg||
nt|bobholl: if they play 14-16 NT even bidding 4@H directly is argumentable|pg||
nt|bt:  i know fredin loves 1NT but this is a little surprising even for him|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: it's quite a NT-friendly hand though|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Henryb:  Certainly an eccentric action|pg||
nt|bt:  i guess opening 1NT rightsides NT and then he can keep bidding @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: coming from Fredin it doesn't surprise me |pg||
nt|Minihopp:  Ekenberg has pretty nice cards regardless if partner has @D or black suits|pg||
nt|bt:  bidding @H firsts might have partner bidding NT|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  but all those queens?|pg||
nt|bt:  always bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: especially if he has black suits though|pg||

mb|p|nt|Minihopp:  if there's one thing NS do it's change their nt-system :) not sure how many night they've been talking about it..|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  also their 1@D-system is under construction all the time|pg||
nt|bt:  How can I put this kindly? hmmm|pg||
nt|bt:  They should put their efforts elsewhere|pg||
nt|bt:  Was that kind enough?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe "There is something wrong with the methods if they can't locate a 4-4 heart fit after 1NT".|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  :)|pg||
nt|bt:  I suggest they should stick to one easy constructive method in each area and focus on competitive bidding for a few years|pg||
nt|bt:  it is not like there is a big gain in nuances after 1NT or 1@D|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  Someone probably forgott something|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  You think?|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  4@D might have been trf :)|pg||
nt|Minihopp:  atleast that was the plan|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: If partner didn't KQ tight in clubs, slam could be close|pg||

nt|Minihopp:  haha|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: I think 4@d was trying to set a trump|pg||

nt|Minihopp:  There will be a discussion about this board tonight and on tuesday when they're practising I know I'll hear "we have to discuss our nt-system" :)|pg||

nt|Minihopp:  (Hopefully EW)|pg||
