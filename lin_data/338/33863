mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|nilsland:  we here from TD that 2H+2 was the final result|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: North didn't open his 11-count|pg||

nt|vugraphzaa: WIth 5-5 in the reds East would probably have bid 2@d|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I think he will work it out - East has kept all hearts|pg||
nt|nilsland:  if he had discarded a heart declarer had a losing endplay option, but not now|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Only question is if East has K-stiff|pg||
