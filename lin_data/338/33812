nt|jcmax:  Mats, do you think it might be an idea to pass over 1@s with the E hand hoping the opponents get to NT, where you can cash all those @s tricks?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  2S seems to go 1 down from then top, but with a trump promotion it may well be 2 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax:	NS doing well here not to compete any more.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|nilsland:  The bad thing about passing if that after 1N-3N partner will have the lead - and then you must double!|pg||
nt|jcmax:  It is usually sound strategy not to comete without shortness in the opponents' suit|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Would you double if you passed Sabine?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  if the bidding went 1N-3N?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Good question, really haven't thought it through yet. The whole idea only just struck me when I saw the hand.|pg||

nt|nilsland:  Another slub now is not enough - defense must first cash the diamonds|pg||
nt|nilsland:  club*|pg||

mb|d|nt|jcmax:	It's really more the other way around. We need to play Flannery, because of the rest of the system. It's not my favourite convention :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I often predict - but I seem to overestimate the players :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|jcmax:	This is typical of how aggressive bidding has become these days. Often the hand with the most hcp hears 3 bids in fornt of them|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East has nowhere to go...|pg||
nt|nilsland:  sooner or later he will have to lead hearts from the King|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Because of the double declarer is bound to pick up the trump suit for sure.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Probably he should have been pitching hearts, not spades to keep exit cards|pg||
nt|nilsland:  NystrÃ¶m will regret not playing a heart in trick 3, maybe also logical after the double to put partner with strong enough trumps, dont you think?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I do. but Upmark could have made it easier for him|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Could it have been a signalling issue?|pg||

nt|Henryb:  For most people it is easy to find a defense: yell at partner :) before s/he tells you what you did wrong :(|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Enterprising 3N opening at the other table. Usually something happens, when one takes that action :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I am not sure I like Wests rebid 1@S with 3spades and a solid club suit|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it certainly rules out 3@DX|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Mats, that reminds me of the old support dbl dispute.|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Some people play one HAS to dbl with 3cd support, otherwise one can't show it anymore.|pg||

mb|d|mb|3N|nt|nilsland:  East has learned 3@H but now with another hand :)|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Mats, shall we do some guessing again?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax:  E cannot bid 1D naturally, so 1S was a number of hands including this one.|pg||
nt|jcmax:  3H was shortness in H. How does that sound?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Yes this is Easy - East bids spade and hearts so he promise diamonds|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Lol!|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jcmax:  Oh you were right! 3H was alerted as D.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|nilsland:  that was after I told him :)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3N is in no danger here|pg||
nt|nilsland:  not with @D3-2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  and he also has 9 top tricks without the @D suit|pg||
nt|jcmax:  No, nothing bad can happen here. No matter how declarer decides to play the D suit.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jcmax:  Do you think declarer will consider taking a 1st round finesse in D because of the dbl?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  he does not have the @D7 so no complications ....|pg||
