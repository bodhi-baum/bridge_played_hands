mb|3S|nt|wstuart: However, there are times which it's right to go for an overtrick at IMPs.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kareno: Surely - but not risking your contract.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|wstuart: Kit Woolsey did an analysis some years ago and published that there were 6-7 IMPs to be won on overtricks in a 28 board match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: that's a pretty decent number in a tight match.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|strike12: 4@h from North looks a bit more overbid |pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|wstuart: @C lead is clear, but necessary here|pg||
nt|kareno: That's true.  And in a long match, those part-score swings become very important - the team that wins most of the partscore swings generally wins the match.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|wstuart: after they have shown all the keycards (with 5NT) it's not as obvious to lead the @CJ as it would have been against a small slam.|pg||
nt|kareno: That was the lead to break the slam.|pg||
nt|kareno: In a perfect world, south would declare 6nt|pg||
nt|kareno: This is most definitely a poor slam.  We agree on that - but we've all been in worse!|pg||
nt|wstuart: without a @C lead it's actually not so bad|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
