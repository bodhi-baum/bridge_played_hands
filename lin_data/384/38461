mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Clinch: I see Justin Hackett - the Manchester United fan - is playing (Jason supports Man City)|pg||

nt|vugraphzad: what's an overtrick worth in a 3 board match? might have been worth hoping they let him make 13 not knowing of J@H|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vugraphzad: last track, director came in here, then someone else came in and had a go at him, had to check he didn't see the screen :P|pg||
nt|Clinch: 4@s could have made here, as defence didn't continue trumps|pg||
