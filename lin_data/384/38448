mb|1D|nt|Clinch: Hi Mike|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3D|nt|mdgraham:  Hi Peter|pg||
nt|Clinch: I'm not overfamiliar with the format, but I believe it's an all-play-all teams final|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Clinch: East's hand looks ripe for a competitive double now, though might prefer more club tolerance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|Clinch: Gosh, an inspired pass by West|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  knock-out leading to an all-play-all final|pg||
nt|Clinch: Ah ok thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzad: 3 board rounds vp scored I think, 2 board rounds in the later session|pg||

nt|mdgraham:  up to the paretrnership to define whether 3@S is forcing in this kind of auction, but I wouldn't mind betting that a lot haven't |pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  3@D also a possibility for South - four trumps and all that	|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Clinch: 4@s easy to make here with everthing lying well for declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham:  but you would think W could do something over 2@D - either 2@s  or a support double (if played)    |pg||
nt|Clinch: So this time, conservatism unrewarded|pg||
nt|Clinch: Yes, in the absence of a support double I'd raise @s - nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
nt|vugraphzad: I will be closing the room after each 3 board round to reset|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham:	also would double 2@d  rather than 3@C - particularly as it looks as if EW play that 1@c could be short|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Clinch: The @d bids of NS have actually made game a little more attractive...in, say, an uninterrupted auction starting with a weak NT, easy to stop in 2@s|pg||
