nt|Clinch: When boards played =27, those VPs will be "in the bank"|pg||
nt|vugraphzad: one more round before the break I think, then about an hour, then you'll have two different operators and, I think, two board rounds. I pity the people who have to do that :) it's ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzad: more admin than bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzad: setting up for last round now, see you soon|pg||
