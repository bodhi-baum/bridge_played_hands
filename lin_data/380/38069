mb|2S!|nt|uni_dennis: 2@s = @s + minor|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Presumably 2@S shows spades and a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphzee: sorry for the first boards, first loaded the wrong games and then connection problems|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Some would open with a straight weak two, if that is what they were playing, but perhaps not vulnerable in the first seat.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: south will correct to the minor now|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: but North even shows max.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  A friend of mine sometimes exclaims: 'How can I hold five spades?! I would have opened 2@S with that.'|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|uni_dennis: too high now|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@s = max with 4+@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: some would play a max shows 5-5|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Ambitious bidding by South. When team mates of mine overstretched to 5@C or 5@D, I would helpfully remind them that it was only one trick short of a slam. South was looking for 'perfect cards'.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Also, the difference between a 5-4 fit and a 4-4 fit is immense.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: difficult lead problem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|uni_dennis: leading a passive trump with @s qxx not attractive|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  That's right. He fears that the spades will be set up for discards and chooses an aggressive lead in one of the other suits.|pg||

At the other table, West was very cautious - obviously not certain that he had length opposite. (1@C alerted as possibly short)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  2@C shows a sound spade raise and 2@D appears to be an artificial strong move (the red outline from the operator means that the bid was alerted).|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Maybe East should not mess around any further and just bid 4@S now.|pg||
