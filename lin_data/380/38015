nt|winkle:  2N is not as comfortable as 2@C, but it's not obviously down.  it will be a race between declarer and defense.|pg||
nt|winkle:  if declarer sets up his clubs first he can get 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|medwards: So a battle, not in bidding though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|winkle:  but if defense switches to a diamond they can get 2 spades, 2 diamonds, and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|kareno:	If north/south playing Precision, then if their 2@c demands six cards, north should probably pass 2@c since diamonds could be much shorter than the clubs as here.|pg||

nt|sunsamvar:  draw trumps and float the @sT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco: "from an honor you lead 3rd and 5th?" Bocchi: "we always lead a count card" (that's my shorthand for what he said)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similar situation arose yesterday where opening leader seemed not to be helped by partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure would be nice if somebody wrote definitive article about Anti-Lead DBL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I think the beginning was something like "we don't care" so I guess he means would lead low whether had an honor or not with 3 or more cards in suit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant see the problem - not much choice for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if NS use them, but the idea is that the overcalled suit is treated as normal lead, so DBL says  don't do the normal thing|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  he only needs the @Ss 4-2 if @Cs are 3-3  but here @Ss are much more friendly|pg||

nt|kareno:  You cannot afford a club shift.  I think you test diamonds first|pg||
