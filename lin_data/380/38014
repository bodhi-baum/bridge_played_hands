nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco: J of spades was a bad card because 7NT is cold|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The director came back and said that the rule about not opening 1NT with fewer than 10 does not apply to Super Chart events, so there wasn't a problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: The teams are discussing whether they want to start early. We'll let you know as soon as they tell us|pg||
