nt|paulg:  so they open 1@c even when holding 4 diamonds and 2 clubs, if balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  this makes locating a minor suit fit more difficult, but has the advantage that the 1@d opener promises diamonds in an unbalanced hand|pg||

nt|paulg:  he'll expect to be able to give Bakhshi a heart ruff if they run to 5@c|pg||

mb|p|pc|c4|nt|paulg:  as we can see, 5@c is probably making so an excellent decision by Gold|pg||
nt|paulg:  On a different day he might just have passed up +500|pg||
nt|paulg:  Getting a good number of these decisions right throughout a long tournament is really the difference between the experts and the rest of us|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|d8|nt|paulg:  Given that most of us do not defend as well as Gold, I suggest bidding 5@d on this auction and settle for an easy life and a flat board|pg||
