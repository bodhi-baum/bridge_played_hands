nt|odysseus69: expect 6D now|pg||
nt|jesperdall:	Not easy to get to slam, correct|pg||
nt|athene: one advantage that EW have over a pair playing michaels is that west has shown specifically which suits he has|pg||
nt|athene: rather than just "hearts + minor" which is definitely inferior|pg||

mb|6D|nt|athene: e.g. 4nt could be strong 5@D and 5@C could be strong 5@H|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jesperdall:  Great bid by Helness here - depends on how weak helgemo can be for his bid, of course|pg||
nt|athene: helness is strong enough that he knows north is bidding off quite a lot of shape so there is an excellent chance west is void in spades|pg||

nt|athene: of course it's not automatic to return a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: a club might be good|pg||
nt|athene: you might argue that east would not have led a singleton if he didn't want a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but the singleton might have been his safest lead, if he has @CAQ or @CKJ or something|pg||

nt|eamongall: tournament format can be found on ecatsbridge but its a long document |pg||

nt|ahollan1: 15 minutes past the hour|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: Carroll did very well to lead a trump against 2@D in the other room - many would lead a top club which would make declarer's life easier; he could then lead the @CQ and throw the ...|pg||
nt|athene: @S3|pg||
nt|HedyG:  Bill and Yuan in voice commentary as well, thank you !|pg||

pc|h8|pc|dK|nt|HedyG:  not so strange under the circumstances?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but their politics definitely reduced the quality of the team in Opatija|pg||
pc|s7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|s9|nt|HedyG:  yes the Lavazza team did not play the trials|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
mc|9|nt|eamongall: Indeed but even if they make the final 18 ... they probably have too much to make up  with this weaker(but still dangerous) team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart in just over half-an-hour|pg||
nt|HedyG:  bye for now!|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: thank you, we'll be back very shortly. see you soon!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Well done Ireland on making 3@Ds when Helness failed but I have not studied the board |pg||
nt|eamongall: 40-21 is not terminal at all ... In 2012 Dublin Monaco chinned Ireland by 100+ imps on 20 board  matches |pg||
nt|eamongall: Since then I think Ireland got a result in Cavendish teams v Monaco |pg||
