pc|sK|mc|8|nt|petergill: perhaps it can be 5/4 shape, so 3@S was interpreted as natural?|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew will not think that is a 10 imp pick-up|pg||
nt|JosJ: rather than showing a stopper...(solid enough,  yes)|pg||
nt|vugraphzde: no it was alertet on the one side and obviously interpreted as natural on the other,and what is the reason for that it is hard to say|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT -50, 4@S -100, no big difference|pg||

mc|7|nt|yorkbeach:  which would have clarified whether she had KQJ or AQJ|pg||

nt|petergill: West follows the idea that you preeempt one level higher than usual at fav vul, and perhaps you preempt one level lower at unfav vul|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|JosJ: so the Law of 3 and 2 becomes the Law of 4 and 1?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if you can persuade your opponents to contract for 3NT with a combined 21 points and no fit, I guess you should do it more often|pg||
nt|petergill: Not enough entries to North hand? @DK then @D to ace is too "double dummy"?|pg||

nt|petergill: Yes, it's still -1|pg||
nt|petergill: Only @SK lets it make|pg||
nt|roswolf:  spade king would let it through|pg||
