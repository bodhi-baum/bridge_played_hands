nt|petergill: double squeeze, so the spade dircard was the only hope|pg||
nt|petergill: A bit complex for me, that hand, but a piece of cake for Alex Smirnov|pg||
nt|vugraphzde: it seems like that  :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 29 - If West ducks @SQ, it changes the timing and the entries and might get a write-up in the Daily Bulletin as Play of the Day |pg||

nt|petergill: 4@S also gives NS problems - do they go to 5@D?|pg||
nt|petergill: or does N dbl 4@S?|pg||
nt|petergill: even with 5-4 @D fit and @H fit expected|pg||
nt|petergill: Very tough problem for North|pg||
nt|petergill: Good 4@S bid - if you would have bid 3@S on West cards over 3@H, you go to the bottom of the class|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@S might have made on a non-@D (@H) lead, so 5@D is not necessarily a phantom sacrifice|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: but EW should gain 6 imps unless something goes haywire in the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: I would have led a @H to 4@S or 4@SX on the South cards - would you?|pg||
nt|vugraphzde: it looks ok for me|pg||
nt|petergill: In 4@S on a heart lead, might still fail, I'm not sure - declarer can try playing clubs first ("set up the side suit first") but seems likely to go down, I don't know  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Peter   or Peter	 what addition to south hand do you think needed for Nystrom to bid in other room?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: good hand for weak 2 relative to Multi - 2Nt more attractive over Multi 2@D than over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  borderline for both to bid again|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|petergill: S might Dbl 3@S for t/o at other table - was close decision - probably he mentally flipped a coin and chose the losing option |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking maybe even @HT instead of @H6 would be enough   seems to be that close|pg||
nt|petergill: bidding is so often the winning option and Pass the losing option, except at the five level, however|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if 4@h fails, it's still a winner over 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but as you said   much easier for NS after Multi than after the natural 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: and e.g. club to jack an lead to instant defeat in 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Hard for Wrang to tell that ducking the @D makes play slightly harder for South|pg||
nt|pelu:  yes but then @c to A and another @d|pg||
nt|petergill: Now @D to ace and another @d is the best chance for the defence, as the cards lie|pg||
nt|petergill: but declarer will probably guess to ruff high, playing West for 6-2-4-1 precisely|pg||
nt|petergill: or maybe not?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|petergill: Ruffing 3rd @D high is only right if trumps 3-2 and @D 4 in West so only right if West 6340 or 6341. |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: Drawing trumps loses only if @D 5-1|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps East has @DAKxxx, thinks South|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
