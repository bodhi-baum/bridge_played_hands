nt|ahollan1: or use variation of Birthright  [better known as Kokish]|pg||
nt|riccho:  about some 45% chance|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow   |pg||
nt|riccho:  fact is: a slam with a finesse is at best an indifferent thing to bid; means: you should not care at all about bidding it (losing 13 Imps and winning 13 imps halve of the time) |pg||
nt|riccho:  sabine is heading for imps to GER... Roy should  bid 6 now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: obviously i was sending that to someone else|pg||
nt|riccho:  50% for the finesse and some reduction for 1st round ruffs, 3-0 trump break (which would some additional chances); make it 49% if you like|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's assuming @SA lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without @S lead some extra chances in @D|pg||
nt|riccho:  in a mathematical sense it doesnt matter if roy bids 6. this is just a coinflip |pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: A basic standard auction that began 1@C - 1@H - 3@C would leave South better placed to key card ask then look for 7@C|pg||
nt|petergill: so it seems that the artificiality of the Icelandic auction made it harder for NS to judge this hand, compared to Standard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdc: at your local club, small slam might be good enough, but at this very top class, it might not be|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Jurica Maricic for a great job as operator at this table|pg||
nt|vugraphzdc: well Roy and Sabine don't exactly have a natural system in the OR either :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree with Jurica|pg||
nt|petergill: Sabine and Roy took 14 bids to reach 7NT|pg||

mc|13|nt|petergill: In 7NT, you cash @CQ first, because @C J10xx can be picked up only if in West's hand |pg||
nt|petergill: summary - A fairly well played match - Iceland a bit lucky with a thin 22 HCP 3NT and with Smirnov misguessing the play in another 3NT, a good finish by Germany though|pg||
