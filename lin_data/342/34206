nt|loganrun:  Fantoni would bid 5D over my double as South anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: and despite his @s holding, it is not obvious either that 4@s will go down, so...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|HedyG:  on a @H lead looks like 4@s makes|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|HedyG:  2@s = weak, 6 cards|pg||

nt|loganrun:  It can make after a spade return but he would need to play double dummy|pg||
