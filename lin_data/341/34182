mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: a bit unfortunate that 2NT wrongsided on that last hand|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: good slam |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: north must have interest in the grand slam, asking for the @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: but will now settle for six and presumably 1460|pg||
nt|athene: might he be considering 6NT?|pg||
nt|athene: with a weak spade suit - imagine a 4-1 break; 6nt could make with 6@S down|pg||
nt|odysseus69: delay slightly puzzling|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if they have one bid reserved in these auctions to offer partner the choice between 6 of the suit and 6NT|pg||
nt|athene: Meckstroth in his book talks a bit about this issue|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: west hunts desperately for a passive lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe you are right -thinking and has bid 6NT as I type - noQ but extras|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't find one; looks again|pg||
nt|athene: what do you lead from that west hand against 6NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: tough - maybe a heart is passive|pg||
nt|athene: usually against 6NT you lead passively, although that changes a bit if there is a long suit around|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure if 5 spades in dummy changes things very much|pg||
nt|odysseus69: declarer marked with 2 minor kings - 3 spades 3 hearts and probably a 5 card minor|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: i think it's quite easy to construct layouts where any of the four suits is disastrous|pg||

nt|odysseus69: if pd has heart jack thats the danger|pg||
nt|athene: well, if east had the @H10 here you just blew a trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|d|nt|athene: 4@C or even 5@C pass or correct from south now?|pg||
nt|athene: assuming 2@H was hearts+minor|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|an|forcing |mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 6NT OK again|pg||
nt|athene: if this is a traditional forcing pass, saying "i am not sure whether to double or bid on", then surely west bids on with singleton diamond|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: lightner double less effective when you are on lead yourself|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 7D is a save -1100|pg||
nt|athene: tricky decision for north now; if 6@S makes then 7@D will surely be cheap|pg||
nt|athene: but that's IF|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i don't know, do N-S play any "clever" doubles in these positions?|pg||
nt|athene: for example you double with one defensive trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe this is the 1 trick double - partner bids with none|pg||
nt|athene: and then partner passes with one and saves with none|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: yes they do |pg||
nt|athene: the problem with these doubles is, you never know what IS a trick|pg||
nt|athene: aces can get ruffed; kings can be onside or not|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the problem always is what is a trick - or where is the Ace of clubs here|pg||
nt|athene: life is full of doubt and fear|pg||
nt|odysseus69: worse is when jx faces qxx - and to know about that trick is tough|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: perhaps this was a sort of lightner double|pg||
nt|athene: north hoping if he doubles and leads the @D2, his partner will work out what he means|pg||
nt|athene: win his @DA, and return a club|pg||
nt|athene: there is just one problem with that |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
