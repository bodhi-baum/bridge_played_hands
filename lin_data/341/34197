pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: basically if the @CK were offiside the defence should always be able to beat the contract legitimately|pg||
nt|athene: because east will just get in and play a club through early|pg||
nt|athene: also if west had something like @DQxx he could always kill the suit by inserting the queen on the first round|pg||
nt|athene: given there is no dummy entry|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: if east wins the first diamond and returns a club you don't get to test for the diamonds coming in but you just run the club anyway for the reasons already mentioned|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could of course have ducked the first trick if he really didn't want east playing a club through him quite so early|pg||
nt|athene: from west's point of view, a club shift might be necessary now|pg||
nt|athene: for example suppose declarer had @DQx but no @CJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|athene: now you need to play a club through to set up the club trick before the @DK gets knocked out|pg||
