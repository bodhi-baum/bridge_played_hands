mb|5H|mb|p!|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: there's a reason Auken didn't bid 4@C - i just don't know what that reason is|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|6H|nt|BroLucius:	Same start at one of the tables in ENG-BUL. North then bid 6@C. Robson sacrificed in 6@H and was allowed to get out for 1100. (@DA lead, then king and another spade).|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|riccho:  this slow auction by all makes 7@c unattractive|pg||
