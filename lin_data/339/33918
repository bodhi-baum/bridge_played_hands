mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|petka:  perfect garbage stayman hand in west|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @S is the suit to play ,,nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzaa: I like the 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: He knows he likes to play any contract his partner bids.|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Seems silly to play 1nt with his hand (I think)|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  isn't this from book ..you never should pass to 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Only when it's right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Minihopp:  the perfect hand is 4450 yes? But this it just as good |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petka:  well, it requires that EW have agreed that E can never ever do anything on his own based on the 2C bid, unless he has all the power in his own hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|s3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: declarer carefully saves the @d7 for last|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: You are right, Peter.|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: I think the core of EW system is "flexibility"|pg||
nt|petka:  so, for instance, say south bids 3C over E 2M in that situation. This is passed around to east. Now E cannot double for penalties unless E is looking at more than 4 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Of course he can - and sometimes you get a bad result. these things happen in a bridge tournament|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|petka:  lol, yes yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: But with 0 defensive tricks and shortness in trumps he might pull to 3M?|pg||
