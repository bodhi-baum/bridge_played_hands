nt|KiwiBridge: for a once a year pair they have a terrific understanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm more impressed that i finally got out an explanation before Jane|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: they pactise in the bbo bidding room I'm told, good stuff|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: 6@D looks good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: McManus doesn't know about Ware's:  1) max hand  2) @CK|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: the lead is now 1 :)|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: 7@D cry the kibs :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he can make a weak relay of 3@H  to find out if Ware min/max|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: best he does then :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even if he takes low road of 3N -- Ware will bid again|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: thinking ....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF  McManus asks with 3@H -- i'm not sure if Ware will count @CK as a control|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typically relayers do NOT show singleton King as a control|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but Ware has 5 controls or 6 depending on @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe they're doing something new :(|pg||
