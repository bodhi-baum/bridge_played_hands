nt|lady007:  not sure why verbeek didnt double|pg||
nt|ahollan1: white house just needs to hold on for another 74 boards|pg||
nt|lady007:  even if you are on the same wavelength that 3@h shows 64, it seems that you get a lot more information from partner after double and give him some more space instead of basically forcing him to bid 3N or not|pg||

nt|vugraphzbj: East I am going to think a long while, South then I am leaving to the bathroom|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: so there is a break in the middle of the board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did Molenaar decide Verbeek was 5@H 6@C  or is the Dutch style to always open that shape 1@H?|pg||
nt|lady007:  south was clearly thinking verbeek had 65, otherwise it is not logical to cash the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: dutch style is to open longest suit first|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Steve Robinson philosophy -- if you don't open a 5-card Major -- you don't have one|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bobholl: this one (3@H) surely shows 65 imo |pg||
nt|lady007:  now declarer can maybe make 4 heart tricks in his hand, a diamond, and play a club from dummy. then he wil either get 2 more club tricks and one ruff with the queen, or the king of clubs and 2 ruffs in the dummy|pg||

nt|lady007:  molenaar verbeek competed some but not too much|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: @DK not the most challenging lead is it?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lady007:  and molenaar decided to lead a diamond, instead of a club which his partner supported, because he doesnt want to lead away from the ace of clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i'm told  Scandinavians more likely to say Toronto than Drury|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lady007:  i'm only a fake scandinavian so maybe thats why i never heard of it :-)|pg||
nt|lady007:  now verhees has to decide. in a situation like this some people will bang down the ace of spades because they are afraid of a diamond ruff|pg||

nt|lady007:  but then east would have 2605 and only have bid 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: @CA is onside so he will get home now anyway?|pg||
