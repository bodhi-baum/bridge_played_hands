nt|Clinch: NS don't play support doubles|pg||

nt|Clinch: to my knowledge|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shengabus:  3@s is aggressive, when E-W have not promised a fit.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|nt|roswolf:  against the law by n/s|pg||
nt|roswolf:  law of total tricks|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf:  shoulde be a fighr but spades should win|pg||

nt|roswolf:  this is a 6 bd match|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  north will do well to bid on|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|Clinch: 4@d was a bid that was almost inevitably going to result in this decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|roswolf:  n/s have done well but west has done better|pg||
