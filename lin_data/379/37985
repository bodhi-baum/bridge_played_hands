nt|ritong: yes	it also does not come as a surprise to those who follow his reg game on BBO  |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: For those of you concerned about a stroke, someone from the ACBL has medical training asn is with him now, waiting for whomever is coming.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: For those of you asking.  Jimmy Cayne has been playing slowly and erratically this set.	Play has stopped.|pg||

nt|ritong: fine|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: For those who are asking (and there are several)....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Play has stopped in this match.	Jimmy Cayne has had trouble concentrating.  Paramedics have been called and he is being checked out.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It is not clear what and how the match will continue.|pg||
nt|ritong: basically, cayne should be brought to some hospital, at least for basic exams  now, i do not know how things work in this context, but the TDs certainly do know|pg||
nt|reisig: They have always had medical people available at these events|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I will keep this table open as long as I can, just so I can pass out the best information as I get it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Jimmy is sitting down and talking to the paramedics, but he does look tired.|pg||
nt|USBF:  This segment has been curtailed, because everyone agreed that there was a problem with Jimmy Cayne. Paramedics are helping him. Most likely, boards 16-24 will be scored and the Cayne team will lose 3 IMPs per board for boards 25 through 30. |pg||
nt|USBF:  That's really all I know!|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you jan|pg||
nt|ritong: okay  so we can wait some to obtain official confirmation|pg||
nt|ritong: but as things have gone it close to 100% WD and lavazza qualif|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: This is not what you expect when you operate the VUGraph for the Vanderbilt. :) |pg||
nt|ritong: you have a kind of tough baptism, ross|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Alright, I'm going to clse the room.  Jimmy is working with the paramedics.  The match will resume at 7:00.|pg||
nt|ritong: fine  thanks all for your patience|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Few of you will care, but this has been the strangest occurance in my time as a VGOP.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: My best wishes to Jimmy and hopefully he will be back to his self very soon.|pg||
