mb|p|nt|jkdood: Thanks Ross, great VU Ops and insights and service!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|phil:  all of the players here can play quickly - or give things a lot of thought|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Will do my best. :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Steve Robinson may be doing a little "dogwalking"|pg||
nt|phil:  4@s looks like a final target here|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5@C EW not vul might pay well as a sack|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|2C|nt|sartaj1:  Marty (Fleisher) is not shy from bidding at this attractive vulnerability.|pg||
nt|jkdood: For those asking, dogwalking or walking the dog is bidding a hand with LOTS of trump slowly, rather than jumping somewhere right away|pg||
nt|phil:  4@s isn't exactly cold - especially on a trump lead|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  With two golden queens, Chip might take a pushy action if North bids 4@S but I think he'll probably pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Not recommended unless you know what you are doing....|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jkdood: Yes, walking the dog has some risk versu making the opps guess right away. Its an art more than a science.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: The best art is when the sleeping opps double you and u make an overtrick, when they should have bid on|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|phil:	it is - a good sense of table feel helps too :)|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Despite holding only 11 "points" south has a great hand (in context)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The connection isn't as smooth as we would like.  Your patience this evening will be apprecited.|pg||
nt|phil:  right - the only questionable card is the @hJ|pg||
nt|jkdood: This will probably be a fast claim as well....|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sartaj1:  With nine top tricks, there is no clear tenth|pg||
nt|jkdood: Oh right that pesky club loser|pg||
nt|phil:  I think declarer needs to divine diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jkdood: Fleisher must play a trump now to keep it from an easy plus|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Reading East's count card, Fleisher might find the trump switch which is the most testing defence|pg||
nt|phil:  as long as he plays for @dHx off side, I think he's fine|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  He has to then follow-up with playing low on the second club play if declarer continues clubs.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  But in reality, after a trump return, declarer will play a low diamond.|pg||
nt|phil:  yes, Robinson really can't afford to try another club after the trump shift|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|sartaj1:  I guess he was worried about being vulnerable versus not. I must admit I would open.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Good decision here as opening 1@C as West probably leads to a failing 3NT|pg||
nt|phil:  I would too - and would probably pay a few 100's as a result|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  At trick one, declarer does not even have seven tricks to ensure 1NT is cold. Let alone 3NT.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  N/S probably play Rusinow where the @HJ shows the @HQ|pg||
nt|phil:  NT is a little lucky, look at the spade spots!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: just as it occured, Sartaj|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other room is playing this deal in 4@S|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  possibly West bid 1@H showing weak NT hand-type ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Sorry, no notes were passed on this auction.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sartaj1:  Declarer can demonstrate nice technique by starting trumps by playing low heart from @HJx towards dummy's hearts.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  This is better than the "natural" play of starting with the @HJ because north might have the singleton ace of hearts.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sartaj1:  Nice play there. Now will he follow up with a safety play in spades ?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  The technical play in spades is to start with the @SA first hoping to lose only one trick in the suit.|pg||
nt|jkdood: This will help some with the auction we see: http://usbf.org/docs/2014usbc/acblcards/MartelFleisher.pdf|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  But here, declarer knows from the lack of spade lead that North does not have the singleton nine or ten....So he might go for the overtrick instead.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|phil:  yes, but that presumes North doesnt lead a singleton T/9 - especially holding a trump honor|pg||
nt|phil:  beat me Sartaj :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: The card includes "transfer responses to 1@C"|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Now that the @DK has been setup, he does not need to worry about spades 4-1...Will just take a finesse after drawing the last trump.|pg||
nt|phil:  when South exits a diamond, I think there's a pop-up squeeze after ruffing a club|pg||
nt|phil:  for an over|pg||
nt|jkdood: Garner guessed QX @S offsides in the play, so the over may be matched in other room|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Third seat of course lots of leeway either way|pg||

mb|4D!|nt|jkdood: Assuming trump behave, you have a chance to test several things in order, increasing the chances significantly in 7|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  I know from personal experience, that such hands look EASY in the post-mortem or when looking at all four hands... But at the table, getting to 5@D, is not as obvious and many slips can happen along the way...|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5@D looks to be down though, no?|pg||
nt|jkdood: A double squeeze has been suggested by a famous expert, so stay tuned...|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  On this hand yes....But would have made if diamonds were 2-2 or spades were 3-3....On this hand, lets see what he does...|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  If he ruffs a heart, north has to overruff and return a club|pg||
nt|jkdood: If North protects spades and South the hearts, who stops the club?|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  From declarer's point of view, South has 6H and 1D likely|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Thus spades 3-3 is a live possibility.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Note that there is no double squeeze if spades are 3-3 as South is pitching over declarer|pg||
nt|jkdood: Sartaj and others; good point, play a @c and break up the squeeze!|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Wait a second, does Chip know hearts are 6-2 and not 5-3 ?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  If hearts are 5-3, the straightforward line of ruffing a heart, cross to a spade works|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  yup, I think he goes for the line of spades 3-3...although North's carding is now revealing|pg||
nt|jkdood: Bottom line: whatever line is chosen, it can be stopped on this layout|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  @SQ and @S9 gives away the gag about spades 4-2....Thus declarer might go back to playing for hearts 5-3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d6|nt|sartaj1:  He elects to stick with his original choice...actually I think this is better since if the hearts are 5-3 he can always take that ruff later|pg||
