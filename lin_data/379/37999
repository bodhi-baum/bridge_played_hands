nt|lskelso: East has bid on a couple of poor hands already, let us see what he does with this freak|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|wstuart: his pard is not passed.	an overcall on that ultimate trash could easily cause a minus score.|pg||
nt|wstuart: he has no distr so if pard bounces them in @S the sacrifice will not fare well.|pg||
nt|wstuart: he has no lead value.|pg||
nt|wstuart: and there is little (possibly negative) descrutive value by bidding.|pg||
