pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mrdct:  might do something like cash out all of the minors, play @s from the top and hope @s are 3-3 and there's an endplay in @h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  risking going down extras if long @ds have an entry|pg||
nt|phil:  this would require the opponents to be asleep and not unblock spades|pg||
nt|mrdct:  that line will give south a slim chance to err in pitching a @s|pg||
