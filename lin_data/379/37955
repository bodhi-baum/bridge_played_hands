mb|1D|mb|d|nt|rv: presume next segment to start in 10-15 mins|pg||

nt|rv: normally Tewari's 1n on a double should be slightly better (good 7-10), he felt vulnerability gives him some leeway|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|rv: Chandu did well to pass, Satya taking Tewari's 1n a bit more seriously|pg||

nt|rv: still he doesn't seem to have 11 tricks?|pg||
