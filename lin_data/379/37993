mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S default|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs play 2@S is forced, others can show some single suited hands rather than "relay"|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: after 2N rebid showing BAL game force -- response structure is same as over opening 2N|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I don't really understand why they want to go back to even with the 2@c openers rather than gain space by using 1@h as the relay start|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs in zone 7 use treatment that i first saw in Alan Sontag's Power Precision   where 1@C-1@D-1@H was 19+  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: zone 7  [australia, new zealand ...]   and some Bulgarian Precisioners   use 1@H as 20+|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Henryb:  Was used in virtually all relay systems also|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: my guess Henry - frequency of 1@H natural [4+suit, maybe longer minor]  much more frequent than the really strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh right -  i think that was part of Ultimate Club|pg||
nt|Henryb:  The idea was that 1@h is strong, artificial; responder can then break down 0-4 (1@s) and 5-7 (anything else)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Greco guess @S correctly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on actual lie   duck 2nd @S = 4 tricks in the suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing Q  = just 2 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then needs a parlay [or 2] in the minors|pg||
nt|Henryb:  No, but I think passing 3N is wrong because you want to get the spades as tricks, which is more likely in 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't know if EW have the agreement -- but seems like good time to say  accept transfer 3@S = 3-fit   reject transfer 3N=2-fit|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I don't think this should be responder's judgment. Should be opener's. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: This may be a long afternoon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: keep in mind   a) hampson was always going to declare @S contract    b) 2N set up game force|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table bidding  12|pg||
nt|ahollan1: growing fear that some board(s) may be pulled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: problem of course is the other table, not this one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: They don't want one table playing a hand the other table doesn't get to |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: That avoids the complaining from 1 team or the other of removing their good results|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is more wrong to force the faster table to wait to see if they will play more|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if the players have ever been polled about which approach they deem best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Players would rather have unlimited time..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that won't be one of the options on the questionaire :)|pg||
