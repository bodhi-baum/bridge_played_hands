nt|sartaj1:  If he wins SA and plays @HA and another (after a club ditch), that is eight tricks if hearts are 3-2|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  @HK, @DJ, @SQ, @DK,  @S overurff|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  tempting for north to raise this to game|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but @d wastage and bad trump break will doom 4@h|pg||
nt|mrdct:  or 3@h even|pg||
nt|medwards: Playing this size NT, I would think defending two spades would produce a plus|pg||
nt|mrdct:  2@h failed in the other room i see now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Smirnov's sequence is non-invitational|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise he starts with transfer to @H|pg||
nt|mrdct:  quite a nice defence in the other room to get two @d entries back to west's hand for the extra @s ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Piek is really aganizing over this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Cayne is playing the final half|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: his team I mean|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if you are using the web version of bbo, clicking on a player name will give you a link to their WBD convention card|pg||
nt|medwards: A	lot of time spent on a non vul part score battle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Dan -- any news about JEC?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Piek is explaining Smir bid to Fantoni|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: I have no report on Cayne's condition|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think it is safe to say - there isn't a single fast player at our table|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mrdct:  declarer went astray somewhat in the other room by drawing trumps - i think he can break up the defebsive communication s by playing on @d early|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|shuster:  the "safety play" in trumps he took turned out to not be so safe, either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during 2nd Quarter -- paramedics were called in to examine Jimmy Cayne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was taken to the hospital, but that's all i know   [he did NOT want to go]|pg||
nt|shuster:  the trump situation is an interesting problem.  It is known from the auction that spade ruffs are lurking... so is it easier to eliminate the enemy trumps via the finesse or by ace and another?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nunes is summoning director after he learns Smir bid showed 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct:  wow - first i've heard of that news. i hope he is OK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the only close Quarter Final match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can tell that because the other vugraph match Diamond leads Drijver by 50 [and has already gained another 5]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 10|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm told that in Cayne's match the last 8 bds not played, 3imps per board to opps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Director is hearing the case|pg||
nt|ahollan1: showing depth of field   Diamond was originally seeded  16|pg||
nt|mrdct:  can west claim he would've made a different lead if he knew south had 4@s?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  stiff trump perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Yes, and I'm sure there will be an adjustment except they might like the result anyway|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nunes made lead without asking about the rather unusual sequece?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: He'd asked earlier about 3k@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok - that's different|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it is hard to imagine what else smirny might be showing [other than strength]|pg||
nt|mrdct:  with west and south on the same side of the screen, it's a bit naughty of alex not to tell his mate what 3@h showed b4 the lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Yes, and I thought Piek had said that's what it meant to Fantoin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Fantoni|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: sidenote:  this is why they say every explanation/clarification should be written down|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct:  of course it wouldn't be a unique situation for two players to not have the same view of what a bid means|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  good result for Assael with a @c lead able to defeat 3NT|pg||

nt|sartaj1:  Lots of points but no clear fit.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|d!|an|TO|mb|p|nt|sartaj1:  Helgemo, meanwhile, does not know that they have no clear fit. So he tries to make things harder for them with a jump (Using the vulnerability)|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Sementa has to choose between 3NT, pass and a risky 4@H|pg||
nt|kareno: Hello from New Orleans :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sartaj1:  4@H is too risky with such weak hearts but 3NT has only one stopper. |pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mrdct:  4@s for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S usually maximum of 18 hcp  -  unless they've changed more than just the sometimes mini-NT|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:	S can scramble for 7 tricks in @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that will happen a lot Andy - since all 4 pairs are playing such similar systems	 [cough cough]|pg||
nt|mrdct:  no coughing please|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s that clear? Instead of 4@s?|pg||
nt|medwards: Four spades would be a good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think if you're going to bid 4@S with no encouragment from partner -- you open 4@S|pg||
nt|mrdct:  whilst 4@s may be a good save, south would have some hopes of beating 3NT if, for example, @dK is an entry|pg||
nt|medwards: Usually, 7-222 is not good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after EW have exchanged info -- jump to 4@S seems suicidal|pg||
nt|andyv:  it is painless, though|pg||
nt|mrdct:  if NS were going to take the save in 4@s, south needed to open 4@s|pg||

nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzff: Nunes: Sorry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do you duck once  or too scared about @H shift and confident that @DK in the slot??|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think ducking is right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even @H shift shouldn't be a concern -- extremely unlikely that Piek has more than 1@S|pg||

mb|3C!|an|Short !c's GF many|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|shuster:  QTx of hearts is a very poor holding for that call and KQJxx of diamonds is not the same as xxxxx in clubs.  2@D and pass are also contendors for an initial action|pg||

mb|4N|nt|shuster:  what a shock to find your partner has primary heart support in a strong NT... when you hold THAT!  Slam is makable by elimating the black suits and playing on diamonds|pg||

nt|shuster:  as usual, key cards are only half the story.  He finds they have them all, but it is the quality of the secondary fit that makes slam good or bad here... |pg||
nt|sartaj1:  plus upside of East holding !K10 or !Q10|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Another option is to play East for the @D10 and West for the !KQ.....The succesful line , as we can see, is to play for this layout. But that is far from clear|pg||

nt|sartaj1:  Instead he finds a better play of ducking the heart. Very subtle.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sartaj1:  This induces Helgemo to consider the possibility that declarer has three hearts and wants to ruff one in dummy. Thus the trump switch.|pg||

mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfd: Sementa looks in Helness' hand and claims|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: BREAK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: All have left|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  The Italian style is to open preempts very conservatively (compared to other top teams). Pass and 2@S could have a wide range of hands, including some which many would think of as a "normal 2@S opening bid".|pg||
nt|kareno: Spectators, this is not like the local club game.  These folks are congenial, there is almost never a director call, and they become friends all around the world of bridge.|pg||
nt|Harmon: they charge more than a club game too:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, yes.  When they get to the rounds where screens are in use, they play $30 per session - more like golf fees than bridge ones.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  when the quarters were 16 boards long, everyone knew to take a break after 8.  Now that they are 15, everyone is confused instead|pg||

nt|kareno: Well, 5@c will fetch.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: 3n on a club lead ew|pg||
nt|shuster:  both 4@H and 5@C will make, although 4@H is the superior contract.  Finding the 4-4 heart fit requires a special overcall that not many play|pg||

nt|shuster:  if he plays the @DA first though, he'll make for sure|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Who's Lead????|pg||

nt|kareno: Depends on the auction.  If trumps are agreed, it asks for high honors - if not it asks partner to choose a place to play a slam.|pg||
