mb|1S|an|t/o|nt|wstuart: Insusrance is also an interesting topic - and it also pertains to the relative payouts from the IMP scale.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 3N EW?|pg||
mb|d|nt|wstuart: yesterday there was a fascinating hand where both sides opened 2@S and then the preemptor ended up taking a phantom sacrifice.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|wstuart: Sami Moyse, who wrote a series of articles in the Bridge World circa 1950 about the merits of the 4-3 fit and how to handle them in the card play.|pg||

nt|wstuart: He certainly started the commandment on 4-3 fits  :)|pg||

nt|jkdood: If I hear any news about Mr. Cayne, I will certainly share. Thanks all for asking.|pg||
nt|pelu:  we can see that @cK and @C to A + @h ruff = down 3, but the play from E was safe for down 1 if S had @cA|pg||
