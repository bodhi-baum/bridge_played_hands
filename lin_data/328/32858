mb|4C|nt|rv: suppose Suhas's 3@c shows fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rv: on precision 1@c-1n, 2@c is stayman/relay, 2@d/2@h/2@s are natural, 2n shows @cs by strong @c opener since 2@c is relay|pg||
nt|rv: 4@c could be setting suit for cue purposes (don't think it is auto-RKC)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|rv: some play 4m as auto-RKC if suit is explicitly set in a GF auction, a few others play redwood/kickback for minor RKC|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: playing kickback, 4m+1 is RKC for minor (4@d for @c, 4@h for @d), a few play 4@h as RKC for either minor|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|12|nt|rv: here, my guess is 4@h is cue, 4n is RKC and 5@c shows 1 or 4|pg||
