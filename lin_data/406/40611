nt|gebeceli: this lead may deserve 1 imp|pg||
nt|petergill: 5Nt is usually "pick a slam" - perhaps West intended it to mean "I have about as good a hand as I can for my 3@C bid". If I'm wrong, someone Swedish can probably correct me?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@C cue was designed to avoid 6@S if they had 2 diamond losers|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|nick jacob:  will the intervention help or hinder them?|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: their slam bidding to date has been good from what I've seen of the, nice grand the other day :)|pg||
nt|nick jacob:	I think it will help. Jamie is an aggressive young man at the bridge table - he jumped to 7@H the other day without caring about the queen of trumps, so I think if Stephen doubles, he'll get excited|pg||
nt|nick jacob:	just so, Gary|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  now Jamie thinks... you really have a 2NT bid, partner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: Yes and that was against Croatia!|pg||
nt|nick jacob:	now if he transfers to spades at the three level, Stephen should super accept in my opinion|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: great major stops but none in @D's :)|pg||
nt|nick jacob:	no hard feelings eh Ognjen? :)|pg||

nt|nick jacob:	especially with no tenaces to protect in the West hand|pg||

mb|d|nt|nick jacob:  Jamie will key card, find out he is missing one keycard, and bid slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzba: He is worried about @d.|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: yes perhaps X better than 2NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: I think W should have bid something other then 4@s.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:	yes agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzba: 5@c now?|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: they need to reach 6@S|pg||
nt|nick jacob:	I don't mind the 2NT bid. it just gets the values off his chest quickly and doesn't reveal to North which major his partner holds|pg||

mb|p|nt|Aurora:  Many thanks  @H to all commentators, operators and kibitzers, see you in about 1 hour and 15 minutes for the next session. |pg||
nt|petergill: Red suits, at least 5/5|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Too much for 3@D? Perhaps 3@C to show a max passed hand? Or 4@D, the value bid|pg||
nt|petergill: N thinking about whether to settle for 5@D or try for slam|pg||
nt|cathychua: 3C lets partner take another descriptive bid. Could be handy. Imagine his clubs are spades.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|petergill: and what do his bids mean now? Is 4@S a cue bid or is 4@S 3550?|pg||
nt|cathychua: I would like another diamond to be suggesting five.|pg||
nt|petergill: I hope south figures it out|pg||
nt|petergill: scary moment for Australia|pg||
mb|4N|nt|petergill: Good bid, 4Nt slam try|pg||
nt|petergill: South could also have bid 5@c, I think|pg||
nt|cathychua: South's hand is gold if 4S is shortage.|pg||
nt|petergill: South is a passed hand, so he has a good hand, but lacks the 4th diamond which the 4@D bid usually has|pg||
nt|vugraphzam: after lunch brake we continue at 14.30|pg||
nt|Matthewb: 5@C by Harrison could've been a good bid for the same reason we saw Ekenberg bid 4@H on board 19|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|petergill: I think N will bid 6@D now|pg||
nt|petergill: Too slow by me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Matthewb: On 29 Karlsson originally passed the north hand, keeping Zlatan out of game.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|petergill: How to play it?|pg||
nt|petergill: Win @DA, @HAK, ruff heart?|pg||
nt|cathychua: The lead must be comforting to declarer, feels like they are breaking now.|pg||
nt|petergill: then club to king, ruff club, ruff spade, draw trumps and think how lucky it is that both red suits behaved well?|pg||
nt|Matthewb: On that line Peter if the heart is overruffed and another trump played Henbest will be going down|pg||
nt|petergill: good point abou the trump lead|pg||
nt|cathychua: That's when you say underbid partner.|pg||
nt|petergill: so you propose winning @DK at Trick One then, Matt? |pg||
nt|petergill: If @HJ or @HQ drops under the AK, then declarer switches tack, ruffing a club and losing a heart later, making on 4-2 heart breaks|pg||
nt|Matthewb: A good point. I was suggesting a club ruff first|pg||
nt|petergill: most specs like the idea of ruffing a club first. ok|pg||
