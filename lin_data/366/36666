nt|TopWizard:  Nor mine, its the present not the past :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Looks like a routine game to start, likely +450 N-S|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: seems to me rod has a 4@h overcall|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kareno: You know when you've worked hard analyzing board by board, it's hard to remember afterwards.  There were a succession in the last quarter of pickups to the Gupta team culminating ...|pg||
nt|kareno: in a last few IMPs and a complete tie score.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  But E-W can go -100 in 5@h X|pg||
mb|3S|mb|5H|nt|ritong: nice quiet board to start with|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Meck jumps immediately of course|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: 5@h a typical pressure bid by Meckstroth.	|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  First blood to Gupta it would seem|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: guess meck will not suffer a lot to find his pard's lightner|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  I think Rod X means he has 1 trick?|pg||
nt|kareno: Here's a synopsis from a spec:  Gupta was leading by 7 Imps with 3 boards to go, on board 62 Meckwell were in 3NT making 5 for +460 but at the other room the contract was 2@dX ...|pg||
nt|kareno: going down 4 for -800 worth 8 IMPs to put Kasle ahead by 1|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Or Lightner?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 10-15, 2+@D|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Al|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|andyv:  decent 4@s contract for EW and with unfavorable vul, NS may not be able to compete to 5 level.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = F1  usually 5+@D, but what are ya gonna do|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4S|nt|andyv:  N's bid may propel them to 5 and it looks like it did just that|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s bid by E may backfire here in regards as to how to play the @d suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but 3@S looks like normal bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@s can be set by W underleading his @s suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand in a row where potential underlead comes into play - but  1 played from the wrong hand |pg||
nt|andyv:  Ace @s lead in other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't decide which auction makes it easier for EW to take out insurance|pg||
nt|andyv:  Gaylor giving this lead a lot of thought.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since we're on a first name basis	    w:Gaylor  n:Bart  e:Larry  s:Lew|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul makes 5@s very tempting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kasle tanking on the bid, he first asked Stansby for clarification of 4s ("natural forcing raise")|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Niki|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  big swing for EW no matter what happens|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Chambers can't afford to test @c's of course :)|pg||

nt|warrens:  this should make whether he guesses @D's or not|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Yes, thanks for msgs . . . trump endplay on Rodwell also!|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|andyv:  this one should get to the stratosphere also|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it did NOT end the auction|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: 5@D makes @HK worthless  [and @SQ]  so  4N seems like a reasonable shot|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice bid|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: so far -- duplicating auction in Closed Room|pg||
nt|andyv:  S may take out insurance|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he does|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  need a @d lead to set 5NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  although S may still be subject to squeeze or endplay|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meckwell invert the normal treatment of P/DBL in Forcing Pass situations|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i never remember how to explain the bids|pg||
nt|andyv:  I typed too fast....meant to say that @d lead was only lead that didn't give 5NT away immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:	that's surprising (no double)|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  At this level, all at table know what's happening|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|TopWizard:  NOTE:  ACBL does not "pre-select" hands, this is a random set of Boards!!|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Could be flat, could be swingy, ACBL has other better things to do than that . . .|pg||
nt|ritong: a 4@d bid by south was acvail, so i think shermers will conclude equal length|pg||
nt|ritong: schermers*|pg||
nt|ritong: -s|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Schermer seems to have no reason to move over this?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meckstroth thinking hard|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Both M finesses "on" but no entries to North|pg||
nt|kareno: It may be Meckstroth thinking - do the bids come 2 at a time?|pg||
nt|ritong: surely yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yeah, I put them two at a time|pg||
nt|kareno: Good job!!|pg||
nt|kareno: Stella in my lap checking out the auction :)|pg||
nt|ritong: meck might compete to 4NT|pg||
nt|ritong: super tough spot|pg||
nt|kareno: 4nt is a winner unless south leads a diamond!!|pg||
nt|ritong: thinking his @h K would be dogmeat if the hand is played in @ds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|ritong: now the real decision|pg||
nt|kareno: South hand in trouble on the run of eight minor suit cards.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  S may decide to take insurance with 5@h|pg||
nt|ritong: i m asked why 2 bids at the same time|pg||
nt|ritong: the reason is, when there is a deep silence as it often is the case, esp in closed rooms, you can hearmouseclicks|pg||
nt|kareno: So it is not apparent who is hesitating.  That is how the bids appear at the table.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Good Ops think the other side can hear their computer strokes and figure out who is taking time, so both and once avoids this :)|pg||

nt|ritong: the lead now...|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Non-@d lead means likelly Gupta victory|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: wow	 2@H denied strength for Drury, distribution for Mixed Raise  and still Bramley blasted game|pg||
nt|kareno: diamond lead is not one I would make with that east hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: He's primed up and vulnerable|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  -180 is now likely N-S, which is 5 IMPS I think?|pg||
nt|kareno: Good shape and no convenient game try.|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
nt|andyv:  doubleton leads are becoming more popular....still hard to pull the trigger on a @d lead over the more natural looking @c lead.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 180 seems unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: especially with natural trump tricks|pg||
nt|kareno: With KQx of hearts - no way I lead a diamond|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: leading a shortage helps declarer very often, so of course you must have concrete possible compensation|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  As a beginner I always led doubletons, maybe ahead of my time in 1875?|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  A Motion by the Board of Governors asks for duplication from the Quarterfinals - with added security, of course|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: I like that idea!|pg||
