nt|barnets: to make ducking correct|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  If anyone is on site, would you check the score of this match for us?|pg||
nt|shuster:  he probably figured partner had a doubleton diamond, but then ducking isn't right there either|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|shuster:  at the other table, Bramly won the first diamond to clear spades while still holding a club entry.  That was the path to -630|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  I'm told by many that the BBO score is correct here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|shuster:	I remember it as Kasle ahead by 10 going into the last board|pg||
nt|barnets: In he other room Bramley won the @DA on the first round to end the defence|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Halftiime Scores: https://web3.acbl.org/acbl-results/game-results/events/tournaments/NABC143/BAZE/0/leader-board|pg||
nt|shuster:  entry position a bit tangled|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Dummy is clearly squeezed|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Winning @d King early and @c Queen from dummy might have been better, but only on this layout|pg||
nt|shuster:  might declarer wind up needing to play on clubs? |pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Win @s King and play @c Queen now?|pg||
nt|shuster:  he can't run either the spades or the hearts without setting up a 5th defensive winner.  So the spade continuation is a really great play by Rodwell|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  D is poised to set up 2@d tricks now, so probably no way to make|pg||
nt|shuster:  if the defense sets up a diamond winner then declarer has 9|pg||
pc|s8|nt|TopWizard:  I felt from the beginning that giving up a @s somehow lost a tempo|pg||
nt|shuster:  he's cooked now though|pg||
nt|shuster:  he needed to save the spade entry to hand|pg||
nt|barnets: now north can play a diamond ducked by south|pg||
nt|barnets: and def have 5 trciks|pg||
nt|shuster:  this hand is taking some time at the other table as well|pg||

nt|ahollan1: to celebrate that -- the Closed Room crashed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|TopWizard:  I think the final analysis will show that leading @c's early was better than @s's, but probably depended on which suit split so a guess :)|pg||
