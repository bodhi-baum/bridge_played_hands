mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Looks like Jacobus and Hayden have blown e/w out of the water with Garey Hayden's response to 1@h|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno: Lynch overcalled 1nt over 1@h in the CR and e/w are in 3nt.|pg||

nt|shuster:  East with 2 aces, four trumps and a partner who preempted at Red/White could well have found a double.  Or a 4@H call over 4@D|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|shuster:  I think perhaps some early hand jitters by East, compounded by the last board...|pg||
mc|9|nt|shuster:  Underruffing could be the result of thinking about the lost opportunity on board 18|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: e/w take a short break |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: they left the room|pg||
nt|shuster:  Note on board 18 that holding xx Q9xxx Ax KTxx, Bessis passed over the precision club|pg||
nt|shuster:  Perhaps his overcalls would have been artificial, but at the other table, that hand overcalled 1@H over a natural 1@D, leading to a very different sounding auctin|pg||

mb|2D!|nt|kareno: I don't know which Drury version they play.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kareno: 2@d may announce a real opening bid without aspirations.	At any rate in the CR, west just jumped to game in spades.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Zaleski made a cirular motion with his hands, so I think 2@D was forward going|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: It's a good enough game to bid vulnerable where you need only about 40 percent to make it worthwhile.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  what shold be a partscore battle here is played in game, as is the modern style|pg||
nt|shuster:  south will probably guess diamonds for declarer at trick one|pg||
nt|shuster:  but still, East must lose 1 spade, 1 diamond and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|nt|shuster:  I'm being reminded, in stereo, that a diamond ruff lurks as well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: your sound system looks ok:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|shuster:  E/W play precision, which allows responder to just bid 4@S on a wide variety of hands over an opening 1@S.  Here, he bids it, maybe it will make, maybe not, but hoping the opponents might misjudge and bid and go for a number|pg||

nt|ritong: 1@s|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|ritong: introducing the boss suit at fav seems almost mandatory to me|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|shuster:	I have a lot of sympathy with the pass, but it will lose the spades|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|shuster:	perhaps save you from going -1 in 4@S... but go minus on defense instead|pg||
nt|shuster:  N/S can make a lot of tricks come to think of it|pg||
nt|shuster:  about 11|pg||
nt|ritong: abk6 has an elegant hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Abecassis in deep thought|pg||
nt|shuster:  North is thinking here.  3NT will make on a club lead, 5@D on any lead|pg||
mb|4D|nt|shuster:  the N/S hands fit perfectly.  He might be wondering where the spades are|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i am certain that hewill take another bid, even if 2@d was a free bid|pg||
nt|shuster:  so what can his partner's shape be?|pg||
nt|shuster:  he probably thinks the spades are 5-4-3-1 around the table with partner holding four.  So has his partner at 4441|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|shuster:  very difficult auction for N/S.  If clubs were 6-1 as likely by the bidding, they did the right thing|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: now if declarer had diamond ace instead of spade king, Jacobus would need to play a spade|pg||
nt|kareno: Good play in diamonds - this leaves north wondering about spades.  But unless south has a club trick with his presumed spade king, north needs to return a diamond.|pg||

nt|shuster:  2@H seems an odd choice.  It is a difficult decision when you know your opponents have 8+ spades... I would have passed 1@H doubled, but that is NOT a mainstream view|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ritong: what s going on..|pg||
nt|shuster:  I'm so confused|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|nt|kareno: East recognizes  how very strong his hand is for play.  In the CR east doubled 4@s instead of insisting with 4nt on playing the hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Since west did not bid clubs at once, east should know he has fewer than 4.|pg||
nt|kareno: And that makes slam less appealing.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|kareno: West might have bid more clubs with four of them right away...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: new hand, all is quiet, they moved on (for now)|pg||
nt|shuster:  East holds a sound strong 2, a 2-loser hand, and hears LHO open|pg||

nt|shuster:  so 800|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think East could try 5NT here... I'd be tempted to do so, just because it is such an unusual call|pg||

nt|ritong: passell is not the kind of guy to go crazy just because he is at fav|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|shuster:	I expect South to start by transfering to hearts|pg||
nt|shuster:  and then possibly call 4NT|pg||
nt|ritong: that would be cool, although i doubt they have that kind of agreement|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Hello All, Hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hi gary|pg||
nt|shuster:  they might use 4@C to ask about the nature of the 3NT call|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, i know pairs like weinstein levin do that|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  How about Xfer to 4@h, then 4NT natural?|pg||
nt|shuster:  it is a worthwhile convention to have in your arsenal if you play a lot.  Otherwise, remembering what response scheme you're using on a convention that comes up almost never is probably not worth the effort|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Bessis in deep thought|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|shuster:	given he's in thought, I bet he doesn't have a clear agreement about what they are doing here|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  I see we have superstary Operator Maya :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  or he's considering his rebid|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@d is a cue, not a transfer imo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi Gary|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|shuster:  so it was a transfer and he was considering his rebid.  Maybe he was trying to figure out if that would be RKC or Natural|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  3NT overcalls are so wide-ranging as has been said, very difficult situation|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|shuster:  (hint, I would know the answer in not all of my partnerships)|pg||
nt|shuster:  (but in the ones I do know the answer, it would be natural)|pg||
nt|shuster:  Partnerships should settle on one of two rules for ambiguous 4NT calls:|pg||
nt|shuster:  rule 1)  If it could be natural, it is|pg||
nt|shuster:  or rule 2) If it could be blackwood, it is|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Great ambiguous rules, Michael :)|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ritong: all bases covered  sound|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  In fairness, this is very, very tough, S should now pick 6@h|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|shuster:	North has just decided to put it back to South.  That is a thoughtful call.  If South bids 6@C, North will have found a better contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  Here, declarer will get a count on the West hand before having to make the decision in hearts|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: trusting him to hold seven @ds|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Not sure why S picked NT, but N should guess the @h position when the @h10 drops|pg||
nt|shuster:  or the lead of the @D9 to be top of a doubleton|pg||
nt|shuster:  but yes, not a true count|pg||
nt|ritong: problem is 98 bare|pg||
nt|ritong: and possible 98x|pg||
nt|ritong: i suspect the hand will last some|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: abecassis is extremely deliberate on heavy boards|pg||
nt|shuster:  Even with 9x, it could be tempting to lead low.  For example, declarer holds @DA8 and your lead subjects partner to a late strip squeeze|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Many open 3@d though with 6-card suits, which means doubleton @h in W when hand counted out in end position :)|pg||

nt|shuster:  easy to get overboard|pg||
nt|shuster:  E/W play precision, so they ought to avoid the trap.. but may wind up in 2@S|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  S rightly refuses to allow an unimpeded 2-level Part Score - this is 21st Century bridge at it's best :)|pg||

nt|kareno: Henri :)|pg||
mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F1|nt|ritong: other room failed to optimize|pg||
nt|ritong: hi karen|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: They play a strong club so that's helpful with hands like this one.|pg||
nt|shuster:  trap hand for N/S.  3NT is -1 or -2.  Even 5@C is tough.  |pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-7?|mb|p|mb|1H!|an|usually unbal, cd be 4 !hs w/o longer m|mb|p|nt|kareno: Mike :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  hi all :)	We are refugees from the other room|pg||
nt|kareno: How's 4@s?  Not too bad even with the spades offside.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|shuster:	there was much discussion about North's 6@C call, which I thought a reasonable gamble and pretty much everyone disagreed with me|pg||
nt|ritong: i did not|pg||
mb|4C!|an|splinter for !ss|nt|shuster:	i must have missed your support among all the specs PMing me how wrong I was :P|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, if 3@c was second negative, I disagree with you too, Mike|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: So 4@c is singleton for spades.  |pg||
nt|ritong: but, since hann was gone in a tirade against you, i did not intervene:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Let's see if Garey Hayden can bring it in.|pg||
nt|shuster:  4S looks like you can take a lot tricks by ruffing things|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kareno: For a while, anyway :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hayden asks about spot card leads "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|kareno: I like this auction a LOT better than the CR one.|pg||
nt|ritong: as you underlined, big @c is way more at ease here|pg||
nt|kareno: Exactly.|pg||
nt|ritong: although other room auction was not entirely to my taste|pg||
nt|shuster:  you can ruff four times in south, 3 aces, 1 ruff in north and AQT of trumps is going to score 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: for one, i think a suit rebid after 2@c should show a more oriented hand|pg||
nt|shuster:  (maybe)|pg||
nt|kareno: I think the heart suit is too weak for that auction.  Might even <gasp> open 1@h|pg||
nt|ritong: for two, there is a 2@c 2@d 3@s gadget to show exactly 4@ss and 5+@hs|pg||
nt|kareno: On huge shaped hands without a really strong suit, that's my preference!|pg||
nt|ritong: the default solution being to treat the hand as balanced and rebid 2NT|pg||
nt|kareno: Another possibility, Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: but, as said, strong three suiter is a nightmare for natural systems|pg||
nt|ritong: and it proved again|pg||
nt|shuster:  I'd bid it... 2@C - 2@D; 2@H - 2@S (showing clubs); 2NT - 3@C - 3@S - 4@S|pg||
nt|shuster:  but that transfer to clubs saves a lot of space (and wrongsides the spades)|pg||
nt|shuster:  I like after 2@C - 2@D; 2M to use 2NT as a raise of the major and everything else as a transfer|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|s3|nt|shuster:  tranfering to the major as a substitute for a 2NT call|pg||

mb|2C|an|!|mb|p|mb|2D|an|no aces|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|TopWizard:  4-4-4-1 and 5-4-3-1 hands always very tough to open 2@c|pg||
nt|shuster:  N/S could find spades or clubs.  Clubs will probably take 11 tricks without too much difficulty|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ritong: well strong three suiters are a nightmare for any natural system|pg||
nt|shuster:  although maybe not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  S will pull this|pg||
nt|shuster:  I would not pass 3NT here|pg||
nt|ritong: he won t|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  7-4-1-1 doesn't belong in NT :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  there is no club holding partner can have that lets you run the suit other than AKx|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|shuster:	or Ax with a stiff king out there.  5@C looks right, and Bessis has bid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Abecassis not happy, takes some time to think|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  This will seemingly require some guessing . . . let's see Bessis show his mettle here|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Oh, MY!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  6@C... will be too difficult.  Had East held only @CKx, he'd get endplayed once in clubs|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Seems S would bid 4@c with further interest . . . N already showed a 2@c Opener . .  .|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|shuster:  I think North was imagining south with a club holding such as this, but was hoping for another card.  So much as the @SJ would make this contract fine|pg||
nt|shuster:  I have a lot of sympathy for North's choice here|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Yes, Michael, but S never showed any strength either . . . :(|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|shuster:  Abecassis is a poker player...  a gambler, and I think 6@C was a good gamble.  Would the @SJ have counted as strength?  Would South have bid differently with a red king, too?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|d5|nt|TopWizard:  I think S would bid only 4@c over 3NT with further interest, just my opinion :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  Slam is about 55% opposite J9xx x x QJTxxxx (because you pick up stiff club king)|pg||
nt|shuster:  Yes, passing 5@C is fine, reasonable and expected, but I wouldn't be too harsh on 6@C|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Hi Michael, we agree to disagree here . . . I've seem many fine players with a strong 2@c rebid their strong hand, already shown, too many times, just my opinion though :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  At least you have AQ AQ AQ in all the suits they are likely to lead :)|pg||
