nt|Schafer:  Should have a good shot |pg||
nt|Schafer:  South showed a real 3-suiter, but Greco doesn't know it's 5 Solid @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 4th suit FG|pg||
nt|Schafer:  if he bids 3Nt that's probably the end of the bidding.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typically the USA Precision pairs will not bypass 4-card major unless 2-card discrepancy and game force|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 1@D-2@C can be 6@C 4@H/@S, but usually not  5@C 4@H/@S|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: there are also some pairs who won't ever bypass a major|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Standard players might have a better shot here.  Ala Rodwell, 2@C shows 6+ @C if you have a 4 card major.	That's why Greco didn't start with 2@C over 1@D.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = RKC @C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Schafer:  OK, that's the winner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: these same  usa  big clubbers almost all use  jump to 4 of trump + 1  = RKC[0314]|pg||
nt|Schafer:  4@H must have been 0/3 and 4NT is a signoff if it is 0.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|Schafer:	6@C should be @C Q and no side Kings|pg||

nt|ahollan1: is it too double dummy for West to avoid 2N rebid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably|pg||
nt|Schafer:  @DQ followed by @D8 should have been easy to read.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  To bid 2@S over 2@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even playing some version of Bart [don't think that is used in Norway]  i think west is too strong to show good raise with 2@S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: oy   tomorrow reduced to 10 teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 sessions again	|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to be another hospitality break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It would be pretty fun if we reduced to 2 teams - although someone has been promoting a BAM knockout :)|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Didn't they say it was a break last round?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from live video   just heard director announce the move|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Director just told the the break's over, but some are still playing the last round and some are wandering around - soon we'll have players I'm sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Cincinnati Nationals  [before they were called NABCs]  circa 1980	 they had a Regional BAM Swiss event that was FUN|pg||
nt|Schafer:  They still have that in LA at one fo the Regionals|pg||
nt|Schafer:  2 day event I think|pg||
nt|phil:  the BAM? |pg||
nt|Schafer:  Isn't that 2-day Swiss BAM scoring?  I know they had one|pg||
nt|phil:  yes|pg||
nt|Schafer:  That's what Al is talking about.  Great event|pg||
nt|phil:  like a 9 board swiss match with BAM scoring - named after the late Marshall Miles|pg||

nt|Schafer:  Right, maybe.  But they could do that anyway.  Not sure.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  If West was 44 East wanted to play the better fit.|pg||

nt|Schafer:  Something you should discuss|pg||
nt|Schafer:  But maye West can be 54xx weak too?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: West did some explaining of his auction that included he could be 4-4, I couldn't read the rest of it though|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Then Passing 2@H would look silly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told	there are some world class pairs who agree that 1N bidder always converts with equal length - so that strong hand declares|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|Schafer:  I wonder what Hampson would have done if 2@h was passed to him?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: adjunct to that agreement is that responder/advancer should just transfer [rather than stayman] with the wrong shape|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Then you should bid Garbage Stayman with 54xx but not 45xx|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Agree|pg||

nt|Schafer:  You were right Al, and they got the trump going in time.  Wasn't mandatory at T1 for the set here.|pg||
