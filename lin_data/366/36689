pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: scoring in this event is  BAM	 Board-A-Match	[aka  Point-A-Board]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: I don't think there will be comparisons since this table is not connected to any other|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: very similar to 2 table matchpoint  with  team flavor	   you either win, lose or tie the board|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 or 3 boards per round  then table will close and we'll see new EW pair|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: one big room for these semi-finals -- 20 tables with screens|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: in any case, EW will bid 4@s imo  happens 3NT is good looking NS|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4S|nt|ritong: from chen's point of view  both contracts can easily make|pg||
nt|ritong: so it is natural to bid on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at imps vs BAM/matchpoints   does south try to keep @H in the picture  or is @D always better for preemption and as lead director|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what comes of this hand if it starts  (1@C)-1N-?|pg||

nt|ritong: @c Q would be a good idea imo|pg||
nt|ritong: @c A= dead end|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rosenberg has to play for AQ of clubs onside in any case, seems to me|pg||
nt|ritong: he is down if west covers Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well we know that duck can never be right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so it is @CQ or @CA|pg||
nt|ritong: if so declarer has to self squeeze|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: @CA just leaves way too much flexibility  [and major tenace]|pg||

nt|ritong: @c A leads to ten clear tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: "oy"   is MY line Henri|pg||
nt|ritong: east can play @d Q on second round|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on the CC	how do you guesstimate that board?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would probably guess no worse than push	but would hope for a win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or is there a way for auken-welland to get into trouble on the EW cards?|pg||
nt|me argent: depends who buys the contract but  hard to score plus here on offence|pg||
nt|me argent: i think a push is very unlikely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Indeed, as Al said, Rosenberg and Willenken made substantail changes in their system for this BAM event|pg||
nt|me argent: in room A the contract is 6@Ss|pg||
nt|me argent: or 3@Ss X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that 200 would definitely negate the good feeling about 3@H making|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  this is BAM and 10 point difference is good enough for a win|pg||

nt|ritong: for the record, a guy named pierre ghestem, who remains known due to his 2 suiters overcalls, has devised in the 50's a whole system based on xfers everywhere, called " monaco"|pg||
