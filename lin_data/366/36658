mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|shuster:  he really claim -1?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Looks like 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|shuster:  if the defenders found their trump promotion, then well done EW :)|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  I just asked Op Niki to check on last board when she can :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  looks like a fairly easy 6NT here|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Niki says down 1 on Board 47 is correct :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  2NT = range ask?|pg||
mb|3S|an|4hearts no 4 spades|nt|shuster:  It was probalby a club, not a spade on the last trick shown|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Harlan says 2NT = Puppet|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3@H dec did not find the club finnesse so went down a trick|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|TopWizard:  We certainly have a barnburner of a match!|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  4@h I'm told shows @c suit now|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Slam try|pg||
nt|barnets: the lucky game was misse on 47|pg||
nt|shuster:  Played for Q9 doubleton rather than T9 doubleton, a kind of restricted choice situation|pg||
nt|shuster:  very interesting|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|barnets: so pickup for Gupta|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  4NT should deny interest|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  This is on page 493 of 500 page Meckwell Notes :)|pg||
nt|barnets: the fifth diamond is the key here along with working @CJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  The @d 10 is a key card!|pg||
nt|barnets: often n/s open with 13 high|pg||
nt|barnets: so South was conservative|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|shuster:  well if they open often with 13, then maybe 14 with a 5 card suit should accept?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  another chance for the Poles as 6N is a superb contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final 16 boards scheduled to begin in about 45 minutes  but don't be surprised if earlier start|pg||

nt|Henryb:  max|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told the announcement at other table was 15-25 minute break after our table finishes|pg||
nt|Henryb:  now 2N should be forcing and 3@d might show the fifth diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the reason we can start earlier than schedule is that each of the 4 matches is playing a different set of boards|pg||
