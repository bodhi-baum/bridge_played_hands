pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|diumraid:  well I was doing the dish-washer !|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzak: players have been instructed not to continue until the decision on the appeal has been announced|pg||
nt|jacksond:  Both tables have started on Board 1 so results from other room may not be known on too many boards|pg||
nt|martinwj:  it would be terrible for the final result to be decided by committee after play has finished|pg||
nt|diumraid:  So Garvey needs 2 imps a board ! in fact a little more as board 1 is flat|pg||
nt|diumraid:  interesting point - but I think the appeal would have been held or met before this last set started as they had time in that 40 min break|pg||
nt|martinwj:  in the US recently the Spingold semi final saw 2 imps change hands on appeal ....the appelents then won by 1imp having played a hundred hands or so|pg||
nt|martinwj:  first bad spelling of the afternoon|pg||
nt|jacksond:  And we saw where that led to Martin|pg||
nt|jacksond:  I think it was the quarter final of Spingold|pg||
nt|martinwj:  indeed|pg||
nt|eamongall: play has stopped at both tables until they do the appeal on board 12 of the last session |pg||
nt|jacksond:  Time to put the kettle on or maybe cook a 3 course meal if my experience of appeals is anything to go by|pg||
nt|martinwj:  are there potentially a lot of imps at stake in the appeal?|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: 18 imp swing is possible|pg||
nt|jacksond:  There is an appeal outstanding on Bd 12 from last set. Needs to be cleared upbefore play resumes|pg||
nt|eamongall: Coyne EW made 1NTXX up 1 for 760|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: depending on what the result is adjusted to, if they decide to adjust it|pg||
nt|eamongall: and 12 imps |pg||
nt|eamongall: if they adjust to 2@S NS ...that means 6 imps the other way for a total of 18 imps swing|pg||
nt|eamongall: 1NT X XX P P P ... X was apparently @Cs|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't know if it was a single suit hand or specifically @Cs|pg||
nt|martinwj:  so a very significant number if we have a swingy set of hands|pg||
nt|martinwj:  the x or xx was clubs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: x|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: problem is with the xx I think, whether it showed values or was a rescue bid|pg||
nt|jacksond:  We are having a small sweepstakes on how long until play resumes.  I go for 4.15   30 mins for now.|pg||
nt|martinwj:  and the problem is the explanation of the xx|pg||
nt|eamongall: yes thats the problem|pg||
nt|eamongall: West McAonghusa explained it as we want to play 1N XX ... to South|pg||
nt|eamongall: East explained it to North as "Get me out of here" |pg||
nt|martinwj:  well im not sure id have an agreement of a xx of a single suited x of a strong nt|pg||
nt|jacksond:  There was a ruling yesterday against O'gorman when a x of a transfer bid after 1C -1H (spades) was alerted as Hearts and diamonds and it turned out the doubler held only hearts. Cost O'gorman 13 imps|pg||
