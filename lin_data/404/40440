nt|batman98: Congratulations to the Cayne team for winning the Spingold and playing extremely excellent bridge along the way!!|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  And very highly compensated field :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|barnets: interesting slam here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2014-2015	fisher-schwartz  have won: Reisinger, Spingold, Jacoby Open Swill|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 3+suit, maybe delayed raise, FG|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  It seem impossible now for an amateur squad to navigate they very high $$$ waters of the major NABC Team Games|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|barnets: dd you can make 7n|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  H & H easily get to 7NT here|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|barnets: youneed finesse hearts twice|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  could happen.....need 6 good amateurs to get hot and lucky......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key for partnership agreement   does 2@S promise 6+suit or not|pg||
nt|barnets: then squeeze west|pg||
nt|barnets: in minors|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  7NT down|pg||
nt|barnets: but he did not make it unsurprisingly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you could equally finesse clubs and try for red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  So Congrats to Cayne!!  A popular victory by a long time star|pg||
nt|ahollan1: south cannot complain about not holding cards this set|pg||
nt|barnets: in 6N play is more interesting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least not and get away with it|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  There will b champagne flowing tonight in the home (USA captained) team suite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we saw earlier that 3N would be serious slam try -- so 4@C = non-serious  [i think]|pg||
nt|atabey: not very exciting final this time but we all watched so many wonderfull players again. it was super. thx all|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: in 6N you duck a diamond|pg||
nt|barnets: a double squeeze develops with weast guarding hearts and west diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: east hearts west diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: first west has to find an unhelpful lead, then we decide on line of play|pg||
pc|s7|nt|TopWizard:  Nunes was listening to our Voice commentary (J/K if anyone asks)|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe just simple squeeze on west|pg||
nt|barnets: ignore that |pg||
nt|barnets: west pitches after|pg||
nt|barnets: long night|pg||
nt|barnets: for all|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  very good lead......assuming you duck a diamond, you still have to guess well....|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|lrobb98:  Haven't you ever seen 17 and 16 imp swings back to back...will be tied....|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Last choice double @h finesse followed by squeeze, which is actually the line to make all the tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: touch of suicide squeeze running @S|pg||
nt|barnets: terence Reese always said first easy discard is a long suit|pg||
nt|barnets: that shows 5 or 6 hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: so he made it quickly|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  but they know that, so sometimes make the tough discard first....|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he can guess it now|pg||
nt|barnets: South is a great player|pg||

nt|warrens:  this can be made on a @C @D squeeze after taking a double finesse in @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  is that plausible?|pg||
nt|jbgood:  slam makes - but 7?7 is abit double dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: it assumes he plays the squeeze steada the finesse|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
