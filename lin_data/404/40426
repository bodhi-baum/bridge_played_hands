pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ritong: first, 2@d says " i don t mind, pick yourself"|pg||
nt|gracelin: but after partner's XX he thought he could bid higher|pg||
nt|ritong: then, when the 2@d bidder over rules the @h choice, it sounds really weird|pg||
nt|ritong: so, logically, it is an " impossible bid" which shows an inviting hand based on @ss|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 boards to go and the difference remains in the high 30's.  Not much swing hands this set.|pg||
mc|11|nt|atabey: 2@d means 1- pick longer 2- if I bid again its an invitation. jump to 3@s was very very good invitation|pg||

nt|gracelin: luckily these misunderstandings don't cost them the match.  They are going to lose even without these disasters.|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when, as patrick says, this treatment is not ambiguous|pg||

nt|ritong: his 3@d decision deserved a better fate|pg||
