nt|gracelin: The Chinese pair Shi-Zhuang play natural with transfer responses to 1C opening.  |pg||

nt|gracelin: NS pair of course play their famous Fantunes system with most natural openings and 11-14 1NT.|pg||

pc|c7|pg||
nt|gracelin: not this time.  But I guess declarer can always establish the 5th D for a club discard.|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Chinese team here is their national team for the past couple of years.  Shi-Zhuang were members of the team that finished 4th in the 2009 Bermuda Bowl.|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: No overruff last hand but there will be an overruff to beat 4S here.|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	no one is going to play 4S on this hand|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Notice how light was the overcall at fav. Vul.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcwla:  So I think actually both signals - that and the known distribution - pointed to getting it right.|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: aha, this makes more sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: does anybody know what 1NT showed|pg||
nt|jcwla:  I think the "NT" signal - which W went with - was less probative because with AKQxxx and 16 high, N may have chosen another action. |pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed, that was my guess, 2NT instead of 1NT.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|gracelin: West has 2 winning actions, pass and 4C, but he chose the one losing option, 3NT.  Quite reasonable.|pg||
nt|jcwla:  Well, you're hesitant to double the opponents into game - esp at IMPS. Sometimes said as "Must be confident of beating them two."|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Patrick, do you have any view on what to do when opponents warn you 3nt will be shakey, as here|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|gracelin: On double dummy declarer might make 7H on a heart lead by squeezing East in S/D.  But the percentage line is to ruff club twice and return to hand with a spade.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3@D showed singleton, pass implied heart fit, 3@S a cue bid|pg||
nt|gracelin: We all know Fantoni is a magician in making these double dummy contract.  See if he can show us the trick again if they are in 7H.|pg||

nt|gracelin: Yes, a spade lead beat it outright, but I doubt East will have any reason to find a spade lead.|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|gracelin: Guess they use Turbo so 5C cue already showed odd number of key card. and North's 6C confirmed they hold all key-cards.|pg||
