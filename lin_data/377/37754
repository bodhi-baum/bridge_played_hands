mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|sartaj1:  With three spades, one heart, one club and maybe a diamond declarer rates to go down 1...Unless she engineers a position in hearts or clubs deep in the play|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Might even go down 2 really, has no reason to guess the diamonds|pg||

nt|tejjyid:  what I'd do...|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  But that risks losing out on the entry to the clubs so she might win in hand and lay down the @CK instead perhaps ??|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  What if @CJxx were onside and the @HA were offside ? Then the @SK hurts bigtime|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  true enough|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|c3|nt|tejjyid:  the cards lie badly at both tables|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  That is a risky return by Robert Tobing, if declarer held @CK8x it would have cost big time.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  But he has perhaps been convinced by the finesse of the jack on the first round that South has the @CK|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Fiona needs to work out the reason for why North is making such an unnatural play (return declarer's suit) ? It is a hard one to get right|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: she is very perplexed |pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Perhaps she can reason : If clubs are 3-3 my play does not matter.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  If South has four clubs, my play is unlikely to matter (unless South has no other entry)|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  If North has four clubs, I need to put the @CK|pg||
