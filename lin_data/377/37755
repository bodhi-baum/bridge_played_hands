mb|p|nt|sartaj1:  2@H is often inadvised when the major is six cards long|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sartaj1:	4@S is probably keycard for hearts, a widely employed device|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sartaj1:  Guessing the hearts will make short work of this hand but on the @DQ lead, declarer will have a few hurdles to cross (in his mind) around 4-1 diamonds|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  In 7 on a @S lead you won;t be happy, will you?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|sartaj1:	good point, quite possibly that will get rectified later|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sartaj1:  1@D showing hearts, the latest cuteness in bridge systems|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugrapha3: Yes, it seems strange but I heard the words "down 1" and the scorecards of both sides reflect this.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|sartaj1:  Even if declarer thought he had a trump loser, this should get logically adjusted to making. As the natural thing to do is to cash three more rounds of trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|sartaj1:  This 4@S will require careful handling.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Fiona needs to setup the side-suit before her trumps are attacked.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Declarer's broad plan would be to lose two trumps and a club, play for clubs 3-3 or some other layouts. |pg||
nt|sartaj1:  In an ideal world, she'd like to keep the heart finesse in reserve but thats a luxury she may not have.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|sartaj1:  Nice defence, declarer is obliged to rise with the @SA more or less|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Ruff a club and have a think...|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Declarer's problem is that she is running out of trumps by the time the clubs are setup.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|s5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  For example, @C ruff, @HA, @H ruff, @Cruff, @H ruff.....And can no longer play trumps due to the nice low spade return|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  she's forced into teh @H finesse, then|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  I suspect @DK @D ruff might be enough...|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  to setup the deep diamond alongside the clubs for the trump exit|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Declarer however may play for spades to be blocked|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  For example if South started with @SQx or @SKx, then does the  straightforward line work ?|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  No looks like it does not hold up....So needs to get the diamonds into play or the heart finesse it seems. Very very tricky hand.|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  She might have a go an endplaying North to lead @H for her|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Yes, but thats easy for us to say, at the table it feels like North has @SK108 type holding|pg||

pc|s9|pc|c3|pg||

nt|sartaj1:  diamond ruff and trump exit, someone wins, win @HA, play a diamond|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  well, the worst that can happen to her by ruffing a @D now and getting out a @S is that she'll have to finisse the @H if South wins -- which he won;t|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|4S|nt|tejjyid:  a lead directing 4@D from South? No|pg||

mb|4N|nt|vugrapha3: North is asking about 3C, and Fiona just explained it as fit showing|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  The problem with just 4@S there is that North doesn;t really know who is saving...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sartaj1:  Tony bid 4NT as saying "Bid one of our suits, the one where you have REAL length"|pg||
nt|tejjyid:  4@D, to my mind, would suggest defence is an option|pg||

mb|d|nt|tejjyid:  ...but on some more normal board....|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid:  IS this a "Don;t bid 6" Double?|pg||
