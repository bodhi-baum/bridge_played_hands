mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: how many of you duplicate Brogeland's PASS?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: 1@C still 2+ :)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Defenders played three rounds of clubs at the other table (after a heart lead) and lost a diamond trick.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Brogeland plays sound overcalls, Zia jumped to 2@s in W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  N-S judge perfectly and will win this Board|pg||

pc|sA|pc|c3|nt|BroLucius:  Declarer will play on diamonds before trumps, so that he can maybe ruff the 4th round of diamonds.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  So 11 VPs to Gillis, and 7 to Zia on the BAM|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier for NS here because the non-overcall left more room to exchange info|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  If instead he plays two ronds of trumps, the defenders might play a 3rd round when they win a diamond trick.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Next round delayed due to this table's overtime|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scoring in this event is a combination of IMPs and BAM  [aka point-a-board]|pg||

mc|10|nt|ahollan1: BAM is like a 2 table matchpoint event    you either win, lose or draw the board regardless of size of difference|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 or 1000  still just 1 board|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Thanks, Al! :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: its imps and pont  board|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: point a board|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Not an attractive form of scoring, as I see it, because the play of so many deals has no bearing on the result. But experts like it because it gives them a better edge, reducing the luck.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in ACBL-land    BAM scores  1, 0 or 0.5	 in Europe    2-0-1|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Thanks to BBO, Op, Spectators and Commentators :)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  And to Paul Huggins, our excellent VG operator.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Each board is 0,1 or 2 vps and the match is out of 30|pg||
