nt|vugrapha3: A quick break while players use the bathroom.|pg||
nt|KiwiBridge: it's been close all the way, a fitting climax to a great week of bridge|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Its a problem of IMPS scoring that slams weigh so heavily on the scoreline.|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  But then again, so do vulnerable games and doubled part-scores....|pg||
nt|sartaj1:  Hugh (McGann) and Matthew (Thomson) are bidding the crucial board 21 in the other room with a similar start to the auction|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  2 down = 1 imp margin.  We Aussies are used to 1 imp margins|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: the players appear to picked up the revoke and the director is in the room|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So McGann didn't follow suit on the 2nd round of hearts?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: agreed a revoke has taken place|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: played 4@d instead of 4@h|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  OK, @D4 is a penalty card|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|sartaj1:  Mikey Ware was probably afraid of the opponents making 4@S and chooses to pass. Tom is happy with his choice of drury (instead of 1@S). Worked well for him and I like it.|pg||

pc|dK|nt|sartaj1:  As its gone now, he's lost control of the trump suit. Ducking the first heart, winning the second, one round of spades and now a club was the safest line of play (although he was likely going down on this hand anyways)|pg||
