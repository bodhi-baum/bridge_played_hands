mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|TopWizard:  Op mentions we missed Board 36|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = a) 5+@C  b) 4@C(441), <17 [else 2@D]  c) 2+@C, BAL 11-14/18-19|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Excellent start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 4+@H|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  S should bid 4@c Splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Yup, will see board 36 a bit later|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, here is a slam missing an ace - but 6@d is pretty good|pg||

nt|ahollan1: one of the english pairings uses 1@C-1@D to deny 5+Major  but i don't recall which combination|pg||
nt|dburn:  1@d was a relay of sorts, I think (or maybe showed hearts) but 2@d is natural, as is 4@d|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Wolff signoff after Reverse, not 2NT rebid :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to ask if Wolff signoffs can get to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Robson and Townsend clearly not thirsty|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|aardv:  If Robson wins and plays clubs, declarer can't get to the diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gary -- Wolff signoffs ARE definde for 1x-1y-2N|pg||
nt|dburn:  if someone came and told them that England had picked up another 13 by bidding slam on 35, they might decide that the bar was a good option at this point|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Sorry, I've been misinformed for decades, my bad :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more common expert approach over 1x-1y-2N	now seems to be all 3-level suit bids are transfers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that would work well here too|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  My System over 2NT is Baron, 3@c asks|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  But I can't sign off, though I play weak Jump Shifts initially|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dburn:  Forrester doing what he can to get Robson to play clubs - though perhas throwing the ace would have been clearer|pg||
nt|dburn:  Townsend can make now by winning this and playing a club up, waiting to see if he makes eight tricks or about four|pg||

nt|dburn:  in fact, England have a 19 VP lead I am told, but there are 48 at stake in the match|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  E did the favor of inserting the @h10 at the crucial moment|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Could go -200 otherwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: web page only thru Match 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: We have a problem with the next board - slight hold up|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: And Ireland on 217 |pg||

mb|4C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Will E bid 6@d now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 3@c bid not discussed|pg||
nt|dburn:  would be a pretty bold effort|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pass 3@C  then 6@D??|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Townsend, head in hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how many peeks does that require?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  The 3@c bid was very effective, 5@c by S more so it would seem|pg||
nt|dburn:  oh, I see - 3@c might have been taken as a stopper ask initially|pg||
nt|dburn:  but "not discussed" is a little surprising for this partnership|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Can we Subpoena those Levin-Weinstein E-mails :)|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Or were they too hot for the Internet to handle :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  my somewhat unreliable arithmetic gives a 34-14 win for de Botton as their target to win the tournament|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually they posted the e-mail exhange on  bridgewinners.com|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Correct David!|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  4@d should be bid in S as John Swanson says!|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|TopWizard:  Forrester has seen Robson bid before :)|pg||
