mb|p|nt|aardv:  South seems to have shown 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  the lack of a fit will hinder them|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: game forcing but someone passed this earlier|pg||
mb|2H|nt|aardv:  2@D GF checkback|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: and is little the wiser|pg||
nt|aardv:  Nonnenmacher in German means "nun maker", or, idiomatically, "pig castrater".  I suppose Alishaw knows that.|pg||
nt|manudude03:  I think spades are agreed now, so KC and sign off in 6N once you find you're missing 1|pg||
nt|paulg:  whichever bid showed a slam try in spades, either 3@s over 1NT or 3@s over 2@h, would have made it easier|pg||

mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|manudude03:  I'm not 100% sure what trumps are in this auction though, but the 5C bid suggests it is spades, in which case North will bid 6N|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|pdjourdain: becky watkins may be expecting spades are trumps|pg||
nt|paulg:  is 4@h a splinter on one side of the table?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: it has a chance|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|aardv:  club lead, spade switch, how do you play?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|manudude03:  might be forced to drop the @sQ|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: they must leave declarer with an option|pg||
nt|aardv:  with @SQxx South would continue clubs to ensure a trump trick|pg||
nt|aardv:  so playing for the drop is marked|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but that is suspicious as if south held three trumps to the queen a second club would defeat the slam|pg||
nt|aardv:  So this should be a lucky make for Wales|pg||
nt|manudude03:  might need to play the ace and return a diamond to get declarer to finesse|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: so there is a definite case for playing for the queen to drop|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: that inference is easier to make in an open event|pg||
