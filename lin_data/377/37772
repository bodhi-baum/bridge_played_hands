pc|s8|nt|gsper:  And 4@S shows a lot of confidence in partner|pg||
nt|gsper:  His soundness or his declarer play|pg||
nt|paulg:  it was a weak no-trump, although that tends to suggest that North's bid is limited in values|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  but four-card support and prime cards, i think they'd always get to game, just depends on who bids it first|pg||
