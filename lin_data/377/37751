nt|mwigor:  pitches one on the clubs and takes the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|mwigor:  maybe it wasnt that easy for george - but a trump switch would kill any chance|pg||
nt|ritong: the auction was extremely clear imho|pg||

mc|10|nt|mwigor:  the bidding was highly agressive but defending is hard - bidding lots of tight games has a lot of potential to win you imps|pg||

nt|mwigor:  i was wondering if ware would double|pg||

nt|ritong: the loss of a tempo might prove painful|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Jacob has the jack of clubs out|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: back in the pack|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: welcome to Michael Cornell|pg||
nt|mwigor:  i think this sort of double isnt that advisable - it may just tip declarer off to the winning line|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, quite so, plus the auction sounded slammish  not like they staggered into 4@s|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Jacob in a big tank now|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: asking Karwur questions|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: system card of EW in his hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: so let s see if he wizards it out  my bet goes on the declarer|pg||
nt|mwigor:  so i'm not sure but I think declarer maybe has a chance now|pg||
nt|ritong: take in hand and lead a @h looks ok|pg||
nt|ritong: but perhaps better to keep @c entry|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: George in the tank now...this will be a "long" board lol|pg||
nt|mwigor:  declarer can establish the clubs and lead them through ware ...|pg||
nt|ritong: in any case, this illustrates the effgect of a bad-timed double for business declarer is warned and plays with open hands|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ritong: i talked about the @d lead because, if so, they would be in a situation where the @d A is unlocked right now|pg||
nt|ritong: which makes a big difference|pg||
nt|mwigor:  the defence are probably not going to take a diamond trick i think - it will be discarded on a winning club as north ruffs restoring trump control for declarer i think|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: we played 1 board in 30 mins|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: this can not be good for business lol|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes. 5@C is a good contract.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mwigor:  given what mike ware would have opened in first seat theres little reason to open the south cards|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  i don't understand that comment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if you open 1@C, it's not so easy for opps to get to 5, is it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With spades 3-3 you can likely make 6.|pg||
nt|mwigor:  generally if opening light in third you want to direct the lead|pg||
nt|mwigor:  jacob doesnt have a strong preference about the lead he has scattered honours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 12 light at these colours?|pg||
nt|mwigor:  mike ware is so agressive in first seat that this cant be their hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  that seems a very limited objective ... I prefer the disruption aspects, particularly at these colours|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 4 more for ware ...brd8|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|mwigor:  on this particular layout maybe by opening 1C i pick off their fit and make it hard to reach 5C|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor:  but more often I will make it easier for declarer to place the high cards in the final contract|pg||

pc|s8|nt|bjacobs:  yes, well poor Karwur will have no idea where the opposition high cards are, as he wraps up 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an overtrick.|pg||
nt|mwigor:  citing the actual hand is hardly a conclusive argument that some action is or is not superior|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  indeed it is not ... I was only asking whether light openings in third seat are out of fashion.  Might have to commission a study on the issue|pg||
