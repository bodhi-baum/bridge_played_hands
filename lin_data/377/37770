pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2@d would show some values and allows the bidding to start at a lower level|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|aardv:  Declarer can win the board here by getting out for one off|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough negotiating set |pg||
nt|aardv:  which will now be straightforward|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  yes, 2@D=pos, 2@H=neg|pg||
nt|aardv:  In the other room, they played by West on the @DQ lead|pg||
nt|aardv:  no change to avoid two off after that|pg||
nt|aardv:  the point-a-board element is doing a good job of keeping things interesting on this set|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  S must have been worried about the clubs to catch air with the @DA|pg||
nt|chmitty: so if I understand the scoring : if you win all 10 baords by 1Imp, you score 20 for the boards + |pg||
nt|chmitty: plus a majority of the 30 Vps for the total Imp difference|pg||
nt|aardv:  there are 9 boards|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  nine boards, it's been reduce this year to ease time pressure |pg||
nt|chmitty: oops|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  unfortunately Kokish has wrong-sided this|pg||

nt|sybarra: and hello all|pg||
nt|sybarra: (and no one said it was easy but 9 is there |pg||
nt|mdgraham:  sensible to play 3@D forcing after the reverse|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|aardv:  5@D can be beaten on this deal|pg||
mb|d|nt|aardv:  whereas 10 tricks are there in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: 5 club  3 @D and negotiate a major suit trick?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham:  good question now as to what 3N shows - a proper spade stop or a partial stopper like Qxx? |pg||

nt|aardv:  The scoring is this event: 30 VPs in each match for imps (45 imps gets you all 30) and 2 VPs a board for matchpoints (a 10-point difference scores)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|cd be short|mb|p|mb|1D|an| |mb|p|mb|2D|an| |mb|p|nt|paulg:  1@d probably a transfer to hearts|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|paulg:  and 2@d is a normal reverse|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Match 1 scores at https://lederertrophy.wordpress.com/running-scores/, no live scoring|pg||
nt|gsper:  @H lead there too, and now Bird views|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'd hope Smith has shown 3@h with her 3@d call|pg||
nt|gsper:  *no|pg||
nt|paulg:  Brock might raise diamonds now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  or just bid 3NT expressing some double about the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: Brock says she knows exact shape of E hand and  14 points|pg||
nt|paulg:  Smith's diamonds do not suggest alternative contracts|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  one of the stronger 14 counts I've seen|pg||
nt|vugraphzct: sorry that was AT LEAST 14 points|pg||
pc|c2|nt|paulg:  this lead costs the overtick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Patton,  that is what I meant|pg||
nt|chmitty: sounds like a mix of BAM and "normal" Imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  point-a-board (well, two points a baord) plus vps on the imp difference - so overtricks important|pg||

pc|c3|pc|s3|pg||
nt|paulg:  Mossop's club discard could be costly|pg||
nt|paulg:  South is marked with the @cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  otherwise North has a double of 1@s|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
mc|10|nt|gsper:  If so, might it have been a good idea to let N keep the @H trick and discard a @C?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Sally Brock sees it differently, which I've noticed that she does a lot .. compared to me, and yet she seems to be right so much more often|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps that's why she is a multiple world champion|pg||
nt|gsper:  No, it would not on second thoughts|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'd have played a club to the 10|pg||
nt|paulg:  and finessed on the way back if it lost to the jack|pg||
nt|paulg:  so we would both have made it|pg||
nt|paulg:  but 12-6 VP on the point-a-board to the Seniors and a probably 16-14 or 17-13 for the IMP score|pg||
