nt|dburn:  if West doesn't lead @sA he won't get it, and if he does he won't get a diamond trick|pg||
nt|game over: yes, if the defense leads a diamond you can discard your spades on the clubs, if they lead a spade, you can discard a diamond on the spade king|pg||
nt|game over: I think South will bid 5NT now showing two-places to play ("pick-a-slam")|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: On same auction in other room, Wolpert was content with 5@H (as you can see)|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|dburn:  Diamond contemplating how high he is prepared to bid - if he bids 4NT now, how will he continue after five of a minor?|pg||
nt|game over: a kiebitzer suggests 4NT as a choice of strains (we don't know their agreements, so perhaps this was not available)|pg||
nt|dburn:  but he is prepared to bid a slam, or rather to have Platnick bid one|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|dburn:  oh, he could bid 4NT, but he thought he was worth six of something, so might as well bid five|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|lrobb98:  NS have a lucky slam without a d lead.....maybe Eric could have bid d for a lead here.....|pg||
nt|medwards: Takes a diamond lead to beat six hearts|pg||
nt|meargent: after that agressive TOX dont see stopping short of slam|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  Often, it is a tradeoff..giving them more room and making your lead director, or preempting as high as you can...|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|meargent: @D lead no @S loser|pg||
nt|ritong: 4NT looks auto  perhaps he will force them to guess more brutally|pg||

mc|12|nt|phil:	as we have seen, polished pairs play a direct 5@h as stronger than 4N-->5@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Hampson: "I was Morton's Forked at trick 1 ... if I lead a diamond, you throw your spades away on the clubs"|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  If he bid 4NT, that is usually pick a monor, or he has 2 suits....he had little room to explore...|pg||

nt|game over: probably 2@d was equal level conversion and did not promise extra strength|pg||
nt|warrens:  cue-bidding seems like a good solution|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn:  he doesn't have all that much extra strength, in truth, except that these guys' initial actions are light enough that an 18 count is a couple of tricks above minimum|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|game over: it is very likely that South has the @s Q (esp. after he see the @h Q)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|game over: if the defense now continues with a diamond he can simply establish a heart and give up a spade to North if necessary|pg||
nt|game over: unlikely given that West is dummy|pg||
nt|game over: if the defense continues club, it looks like a good line to assume that South has the @s Q and establish a heart as well (@c A, @h J) then finesse in spades|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|warrens:  he wants to make sure he doesn't lose 2@c's, 2@h's and a @s|pg||
nt|warrens:  South could have xx, AKxxx, Jx, QJxx and still have a full opening bid (11HCP)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: and he was third seat|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn:  he may just play four rounds of diamonds, aiming to guess the spade later if diamonds are 4-4|pg||
nt|dburn:  sorry, 4-3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|dburn:  but he has gone for his heart trick at once, so is not counting on the fifth diamond for a winner|pg||
nt|warrens:  he can't afford @d's now, so I think he'll fall back on the @s finesse.|pg||
nt|warrens:  North can afford to discard a @d now if he knew the @c situation|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I was not paying attention when Platnick finally played to the second heart, so I am not sure what he discarded|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he cashes @d's and figures out that South is 4252 he can afford to cash 2@s and if the Q doesn't fall, play a @c for an endplay in @h's|pg||
nt|warrens:  2524 that is|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'll bet he plays 3 rounds of @d's now, discarding a @h and a @c|pg||

nt|phil:  may just pitch on this trick|pg||
nt|meargent: on same start on bd 4 @D bid 5nt over 4@Ss|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  pitching looks simple(and right) on the surface here..then try and pick up spades.....for one thing, diamonds are not solid, pitching possible losers....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  3NT on this board at other table, |pg||
nt|meargent: seems far simpler discard and guss rgt for @SQ|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  could be a swing..3NT very well may make, depending upon a spade guess at other table(A of H lead against 3NT...not a great start...club shift )...|pg||
nt|ritong: must be close if eric takes ten minutes|pg||
nt|phil:  1H is getting crushed, but you would need specific methods to be able to pass with East's (dont ask but its possible)|pg||
nt|meargent: wolpert had a 3rd hand opening but still @SQ seems very findable|pg||
nt|ritong: if he plays south for the @s Q, he must consider if another line could work too, assuming he does have it|pg||
nt|ritong: south might have four trumps, for instance|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco: "sorry"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: While he's been thinking, I've posted the appeals committee decision from yesterday's appeal at http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1511&Itemid=427|pg||
nt|medwards: This is a recording|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: say the @s 7 gets over ruffed, he s not dead yet  it s not that obvious  i would think for ages as well|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  If S opening was NV vs V, less likely to have Q of spades; V vs NV he probably has at least 11 points or so......|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Having watched Gavin for a while, I'll bet he'd have opened without the @sQ :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: that s clear|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  it is close; more likely for N to hold long spades, but more likely for S to have the Q...the 2 probably even out.....|pg||
nt|meargent: wolpert was 3rd in hand BUT it was an adverse vul opening|pg||
nt|meargent: think greco will get it rgt actually i am sure he will get it rgt|pg||
nt|phil:  but may overthink it in the process|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  also, possibly N, with 2 queens(and maybe a J) might have bid 1NT over the X....some would....|pg||
