mb|2H!|an|weak raise|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: this week we've seen a lot of pairs using  immediate raise as constructive and 1-under to show either weak or strong raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: anyone on the panel want to comment about the new treatment?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|kareno: I prefer more natural methods.	Every artificial bid you make takes away the possibility of using it naturally.|pg||
nt|kareno: Good double here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting to me -- both treatments were creations of Jeff Rubens|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sounds reasonable -did that qualify as sound raise - if so weak raise must ne paralytic|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: this was a weak raise after the double|pg||
nt|kareno: It was alerted as weak raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hampson asking about leads and about what kind of hand Demuy would hold for this auction:  "a hand where he thinks we can beat 3@H opposite a limited but constructive 3@D bid"|pg||
nt|warrens:  assuming West gets his @c ruff, is it possible for Hampson to endplay East?  he might need some defensive help to do so|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if weak then South is going to pay heavily for his nudge - |pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like a spade loser will disappear on an end play if defence help- to eliminate diamonds|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to duck the club|pg||
nt|warrens:  for example, if he ducks @c, wins second @c, leads a low @h, West wins, leads @d to get @c ruff, then exits with a @d, he would only go down 1|pg||
nt|warrens:  he could draw the 2nd round of trump with the @h J, ruff another @d, cash high @c, and exit A and a @s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: The nine of hearts is in play here if he goes for the club ruffs|pg||

pc|sT|mc|7|nt|odysseus69: well judged by Kranyak - |pg||
nt|odysseus69: same auction next door except South went quietly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hampson wondering how Demuy knew to pass the double.   Hampson thinking Kranyak has 4=2=6=1 good hand.  Hampson seems to think the double was penalty, but that is not how it was ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: explained.  Director is here.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i agree|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: because Demuy passed with 5 diamonds, Hampson think he did not get an "honest answer" to his questions.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I agree was a private -(someone was saying how wonderful I am - no I lie- )|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Kranyak said he tried to answer Hampson's questions naturally.  Hampson maintaining he might have made another trick had he known Kran had a penalty double.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Hampson is a terrific player, but he is aggressive about calling the director|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Director asking which questions were not answered correctly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco chimes in	"clearly the double was penalty, his partner would never pull"|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't think he'll win this one since the defense can always beat him 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Hampson maintaining that "they wouldn't answer" his question about what the double was|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sidebar - usbf.org has writeup of yesterday's appeal   under "APPEALS DECISIONS"|pg||
nt|shuster:  they really did give him a non-answer.  How about either "values"	or "penalty"  - he was looking for one of those two answers and they gave him neither|pg||
nt|shuster:  this was the answer: "Vugraphzfd√¢Table: Hampson asking about leads and about what kind of hand Demuy would hold for this auction:	"a hand where he thinks we can beat 3@H opposite a limited but constructive 3@D bid""|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as Warren said its always 2 down so an appeal shouldnt work|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|nt|jdonn:  2@C is likely to be 4-5 in the minors with either suit longer, and denies 3 spades since he would bid 1@S with that (2@S with 4)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: also usually not 3 @ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  They end in 3@D which will be an easy contract with the missing aces onside.|pg||
nt|barnets: normal result|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Tough hand to lead from, it doesn't matter this time but Wooldridge doesn't know that. All the suits are unattractive|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jdonn:  He is trick enough that he might even try something like underleading the ace of spades. It's probably either that or the trump just by process of elimination.|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: west might try 5@H|pg||
nt|barnets: asking for a diamond control|pg||
nt|jdonn:  3@S is artificial, essentially it says "I don't have much extra values but my hand is useful for slam if you are interested"|pg||
nt|jdonn:  3NT is also artificial, it's just a cuebid in the spade suit showing a control|pg||
nt|barnets: on 18 when we saw 3@D make 4 hampson greco in 3@HX vul |pg||
nt|jdonn:  If west thinks he needs a diamond control for slam I think he can just bid 4@H, his partner already knows he is interested from the 3NT bid. Why go down in 5@H if partner doesn't have the heart ace?|pg||

nt|jdonn:  This is one of those holdings where, if S figures out to win the ace of clubs and return the jack and another, declarer has to guess if north has Kxx or south is fooling him with AK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Bathurst asks about the lead - I couldn't hear the answer. Now puts screen down to write something tiny and unreadable and now upside down|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Was asking what 1NT by Wooldridge would have been and Wooldridge didn't write an answer so probably said something ambiguous about it.|pg||

mb|p|nt|jdonn:	Yes, or you might just get a club lead|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jdonn:  Well now they will bein spades for sure|pg||
nt|chip: think D lead more likely.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  So can the squeeze be avoided somehow or is it always there? It feels like a club switch from south during the hand may break it up|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jdonn:	But I'm not positive|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: when South wins the heart he must shift to a club to have any chance |pg||
nt|barnets: but declarer can win in hand|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I think W will see the squeeze, and play to keep south off lead as much as possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lall: "g'luck"|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chip: If S doesn't get in until late (in hearts after 2 D won by NS), then too late, S can win A of clubs, ruff a h and make it.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|barnets: and continue with the squeeze|pg||
nt|chip: But if earlier, then club switch beats it.|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Now they can beat it|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Declarer was worried about the ace of diamonds being ruffed out|pg||
nt|chip: yes, but probably S is not supposed to encourage from xx on the Q lead, so might have worked it out.|pg||
nt|chip: suggestion that might be able to catch N in a strip squeeze. |pg||
nt|jdonn:  Michael Rosenberg, who sees everything I will never see, points out that if he runs the T of hearts and wins a club return in dummy it's a strip squeeze on north|pg||
nt|chip: 4 rounds of spades may also be rather hard on N.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  South could only prevent it by taking the diamond jack first, but then we are back to the simple squeeze on north because south can't lead clubs twice|pg||
nt|chip: I think likely he will make it, eventually.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  I think another thing declarer might be thinking is that if he can duck a heart to south and diamonds are 5-2, there could be a later position involving the diamond threat on north|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chip: now all set for the squeeze.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  South doesn't find the club play! I think he was worried about declarer with 3 hearts and 2 clubs, which could be used to set up a heart discard|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Althought that would make this line of play pretty strange|pg||
nt|barnets: @CQ or @CJ now only chance|pg||
nt|jdonn:  If declarer needed to set up a club trick for a heart discard, why would he be ducking a diamond?|pg||
nt|jdonn:  You're right Q or J of clubs is the only chance, but it will never work, already north opened with nothing and can't have all the heart honors|pg||
nt|chip: also, why break clubs? If S had an honor, now squeeze.|pg||
nt|chip: no squeeze.|pg||
nt|jdonn:  Someone asked me about the strip squeeze, the idea would be, when south leads a club and it goes 4 J K, you can later exit to north where he has to either lead a club into the A9 or give a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|barnets: true but better than just concede|pg||
