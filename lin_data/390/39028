mb|4C|nt|medwards: Might take a club here|pg||
nt|medwards: Cue|pg||
nt|dburn:  though Hurd has a small problem - he would like to play from his side, just in case of a diamond lead, but he can't really try for slam and bid spades before his partner does|pg||
nt|dburn:  so his choices were roughly 6@s and 4@c|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn:  of course, Wooldrige doesn't yet know Hurd has spades - he might have a big two-suiter in the reds|pg||

nt|dburn:  better not do that - partner really would think you had a red two-suiter then|pg||
nt|odysseus69: should East have passed 4 clubs - should West have told	with xx if he plans to bid on -|pg||

nt|odysseus69: back to back slams but this one goes down on club lead|pg||
nt|dburn:  this is a better slam in clubs than spades, and indeed spades could be beaten by a ruff|pg||
nt|medwards: Six clubs cold|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not so easy to get to clubs |pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|nt|dburn:  they may, in effect, never bid clubs|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|medwards: Club suits seem to be the bane of big clubers|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, if the minors were interchanged they would not bid diamonds either|pg||
nt|kit: now South has to decide if he is worth a move|pg||
nt|dburn:  unless Greco makes an effort on the basis of his aces, regardless of the dubious value of his diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, at least he knows his partner's "16+" hcp are not in diamonds, so they must be somewhere|pg||
nt|bobh1: presumably N had pass and pull available?|pg||
nt|dburn:  pass in this kind of auction usually implies balanced stuff|pg||
nt|medwards: That would be hard with no aces i would think|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess he felt at some point he had to start bidding his suits|pg||
nt|kit: I think maybe North should have tried 5@D, and then over a likely 5@H call bid 5@S.  Maybe that would do the job.|pg||
nt|aardv:  if Greco judges Hampson is void in diamonds, he may think he's worth 5@S|pg||
nt|dburn:  maybe, but how much strength is South supposed to have for that initial double?|pg||
nt|kit: GF values|pg||
nt|medwards: and would east lead the diamond ace?|pg||
nt|bobh1: is there a case for opening this 1@S? He chose to do that with a similar, although less distributional, hand earlier|pg||
nt|kit: As it turns out, 6@S can be beaten with stiff club lead.  But would East find that?|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@C is the spot|pg||
nt|aardv:  perhaps if south bids 5@S north will offer him 6@C|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bobh1: a bluhmer|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: dont think north would offer clubs - |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Not so sure I agree that this is the right move|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure what Hampson's supposed to do over that|pg||
nt|dburn:  what he did do, I guess|pg||
nt|medwards: Now the club lead is outstanding|pg||
nt|bobh1: would have been a good time for @D to stop the bleeding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wool asking question of Hampson|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4NT should be a general try on this auction|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, this may convince East that his opponents don't have the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|kit: "should be" is not the same as "is"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Wool had the heart queen out, put it back.   Now thinking again.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: its only an imp at stake|pg||
nt|kit: Vs. 5@S, the queen of hearts seems like a pretty clear lead to me.|pg||
nt|kit: Vs. 6@S, that's another story.|pg||
nt|medwards: A lot of drama for possible one imp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: when leading or declaring, Wool often takes a card out, puts it back -- often several times.  So far he has played eventually :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||

nt|barnets: and 6@S goes down|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that helps explain why some pairs, like Moss-Del'Monte play  Precision non-vul  and 2/1 vul|pg||
