nt|nilsland:  there is no danger for the contract - now only question is how many tricks :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  so 9 in the bag, duck a club or hook the @sQ since West ducked|pg||

mb|p|nt|Allan Falk: But if E or W bids 3D, S has less defense than would be expected, and if they actually defend 2NT, if North leads a spade, S will be entryless.|pg||
