nt|ahollan1: takes a lot of partnership discussion AND confidence to use 3@S there as artificial|pg||
nt|nilsland:  but he is thinking about bidding more|pg||
nt|danilo1: Would U splinter 4@D with Madala's hand (immediatelly)? (hope this would be stronger than 3@H)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter clarifies @D holding but makes it very hard to untangle @C position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so reasonable to play that splinter promised @C control|pg||
nt|nilsland:  systems are not made to handle 5-5 fits and voids in partners suit :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just too many systemic unknowns for me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd guess that 3@D instead of 3@H shows completely different hand type and probably NOT primary @H fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H must set up game force  [2@H probably only 1-round force]|pg||

nt|nilsland:  South does not know that pass is worth 11 imps|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Madala sort of shrugs |pg||
nt|danilo1: I doubt 3@S has been cue, rather kind of serious slam try ... and if so, is it possible that North does not have at least @CK? ...|pg||
