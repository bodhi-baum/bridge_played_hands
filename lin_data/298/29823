nt|ahollan1: yes  the impact on other auctions	[positive & negative inferences] are HUGE|pg||

nt|ritong: which, in my view, asks for a 4m|pg||

nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|chip:  It is a long grueling tournament and players get tired.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|reisig: So do we!|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know how long the interval before 4th set?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|chip:	No fixed time. Just shortly after third set done.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice Pass|pg||
nt|chip:  3rd set supposed to finish by 6:30 if started on time.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chip:	Seems weird N didn't bid. NS close to making 4H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 22 minutes on clock and it rolls iver to 75 mmediately|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chip:	Did north really play the heart 10?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 10minuye grace time after entire 150 minute 4th quarter|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|chip:  guess N knew partner had the J to lead low. A of D weird play (if not ruff, why not a club?)|pg||
nt|chip:  OK, now the real play.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: quirky mouse|pg||
nt|chip:  OK, hard work for operator too.|pg||
nt|chip:  and we are grateful to have the operators so we can see both matches.|pg||
nt|reisig: This match will be alive for all 64 hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: table tempo is huge for operator.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Too fast NO good. Too slow really NO good.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: N did play @HT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond ace for real?|pg||

nt|reisig: I meant -1|pg||
nt|sixela: i got that wrong too|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes ..-50|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is last table in play|pg||
nt|sixela: and, it's hard to do when the vulnnerability is posted on the screen|pg||
nt|reisig: Meaning ..specs will come?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you stay open --- they will come|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfd: 12 minutes on clock, should be at 19 after this board to be on pace.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am a bit short of ice. Richie?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Fisher did not get much help from partner. I would have liked 2@D by a passed hand. That must also show tolerance for spades.|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: ok 15+ instead of 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Invented by two women. Can't rememberf their names.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|nilsland:  2@S is simply a good raise to 3@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 3@C signoff and this sequence invitational in @C|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks Mats|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently 2@s is inviting for @cs and 3@c a polite refuse|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|nilsland:  direct 2@S is both minors as most people play it|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Ahh Gazzilli|pg||
nt|ahollan1: open room had  Häxan  auction|pg||
mb|2D|an|8+|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Then 2@D is mandatory with that hand.|pg||
nt|sixela: 3nt on a spade lead would likely make if s pops the K and W c0ver the 10-j as he is likely to do,|pg||
nt|reisig: oh ..2@d = values|pg||
nt|ritong: a variante here|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3NT just needs @CK and @D Q rigth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: will look very similar|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!H/!C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: 2@H  hearts and clubs, 11-15.|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 2@h = who cares :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Gazzilli   2@C = a) natural  b) 16+ hcp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as mentioned 2@D =  8+ hcp   game force opposite 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D  8+  GF opposite 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Al is too fast as usual.|pg||
nt|reisig: Will play 2NT|pg||
nt|ritong: lotan has a good hand|pg||
nt|ritong: many fillers|pg||
nt|sixela: i would raise to 3 with the nhand|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: the non-gazzilli auctions look a lot like with jump rebids showing maximum, good playing strength  but less than 16 hcp|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: similar to big club  auctions after limited opener|pg||
nt|reisig: 2NT a tad pushy ..but good 10's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: also sub-standard spades|pg||
nt|reisig: I meant 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am not in love with 2NT. I like 2@S better, then 3@C if partner bids 2NT. Invitational with 4 clubs.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree roland|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: they're referring to 2@S bid in other room which was invitational raise of @C|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes..Roland!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am referring to this hand here, Al.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  but  instead of Schartz 2N	other room choice of 2@S|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|bobholl: just needs 2 finesses|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
