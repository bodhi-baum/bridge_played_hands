mb|4C!|nt|vugraphzce: 4NT was RKCB|pg||
nt|vugraphzce: just asked|pg||
nt|patricck: certainly a lively set of cards so far|pg||
nt|tinizong: modern bidding here - 1@c bal hand below 1NT opening, 2@c transfer, 4@c aggressive splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|tinizong: that X may end in tricky 5@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|patricck: there are only 3 losers, but declarer can't ruff everything, particularly if the defence leads trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tinizong: gd pass by N - not banking on 4cd @h with S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|patricck: North/South did guess well not to bid on, but perhaps they were slightlylucky that 5@C isn't such a good contract because of the 5-0 break|pg||
nt|tinizong: but EW stand to gain as 4@c are on and 4@s only -1 and may make if they dont lead trump|pg||

nt|patricck: good bidding by both sides on this hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
nt|tinizong: the splinter warned NS not to play in @c|pg||
nt|patricck: i think it needs a small diamond to the king and another trump to beat it now|pg||
