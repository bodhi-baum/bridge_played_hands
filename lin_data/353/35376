pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  the main reason to open 4@s is that it is the place you are most likely to want to play and partner will more than three aces for slam to be fair, so you are unlikely to miss slam|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulg:  it also makes it difficult for the opponents to find any fit they have|pg||
nt|paulg:  against that, you have a lot of defence and too much for them to get to a 5-level contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you know that 4@s will probably be the final spot|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|nt|paulg:  it is a more effective strategy when you have a similar hand with long hearts|pg||
