mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: additionally I don't like to open 1n with 5m+4@s, more likely to open 1n with 5m+4@h|pg||

nt|rv: SRC Sekar from Coimbatore, all others  TN players based out of Chennai|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rv: open 2@c, Xfer to @c and then bid 3@h with Kokish seq?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  both W chose 1@c so there shd be something in it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rv: 13 tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar:  2@c-2@s-3@c-4@c-4@d-4@h-4N-...on to 7@c is a classical sequence|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair very sound reverses, nearly GF, good 17+|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if 3@c is fwd going then 3N is a gross underbid|pg||
nt|rv: I am not sure they play lebensobl here|pg||
nt|rv: presume they play 2@h as GF|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  people play 2N over 2@H for sign off, so 3@c is constructuve and gf|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|rv: they should get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rv: now Amarnath can show @CQ and side kings|pg||
nt|psridhar:  after that 4@H sumit only needs @cKQ and little more ( like !kq or @sK and Doubleton @d for grand|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  now whats that 5@s?|pg||
nt|rv: folks who know their system tell me that they play 3@C = 6+ HCP 3+ supp , they dont play leb here |pg||
nt|rv: with Kaustabh Nandi, I played similar system|pg||
nt|psridhar:  sounds like " pd there is an ace deficiency here, so lets try 5@s on 5-2/5-3"?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  but he has asked 5@d TQ so cant be sry|pg||
nt|rv: 5@h shows @HK+@CQ, maybe Sumit asking for more help for GS?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  clearly 5@s is a grand try, now E has to fig out what wd his pd ( who bid 3nt earlier) wants ?|pg||
nt|rv: 5@d asked for @CQ after confirming all keys, 5@h ostensibly showed @CQ and @HK (may have some other king)|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if they play lower king -i e 5@h shows @H king and did not deny @s K, then 5@s can mean bid grand with @sK|pg||
nt|rv: 5@s is surely not asking for 3rd round control in @s in this sequence|pg||
nt|rv: it has to ask for @SK or anything more for GS|pg||
nt|psridhar:  if he has AX,AXXX,AKX,AJ10XX -wont sumit bid the same way? so KXXXX is not bad to bid 7c|pg||
nt|rv: for those who have just joined in, IR appealed and won brd 28 in last segment, actual match score 87-72 in favor of TN|pg||
nt|rv: diff is just 15 IMPs|pg||
nt|psridhar:  sry 14 cards |pg||
nt|psridhar:  more like AX,AQXX,AX,AJ10XX i guess|pg||
nt|rv: in my view, AC was too generous to IR by scrapping brd|pg||
nt|psridhar:  can it be AX,AJXX,AX,AJ10XX?|pg||
mb|7C|nt|rv: what is difference between 5@s and 5n?|pg||
nt|psridhar:  wd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: good that Amarnath bid 7@c after taking so much time, if he had bid 6@c/5n slowly and Sumit takes push to grand it would be another deal to call director:)|pg||

nt|psridhar:  ok still i dont agree with 3nt |pg||
