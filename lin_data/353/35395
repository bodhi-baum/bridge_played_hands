pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  all the Scotland pairs play a strong no-trump so that's no help with the identification|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|paulg:  I susoect the @s8 discard is reverse attitude, saying do not lead spades|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|paulg:  a low club from North would probably work here|pg||
nt|paulg:  although a diamond tempting|pg||

mb|1S|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|paulg:  quite aggressive bidding to get to this game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|paulg:  declarer will need to find the @sQ and the @dQ well placed to make this|pg||
nt|paulg:  however I'm sure he'll do this|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|paulg:  East's pre-emptive raise in clubs suggests he is more likely to be short in spades and declarer has little choice in diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  She really needs one of the players to take a very long think|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|paulg:  Actually we are not linked to the other table, so I suspect she'll have to shut the table down shortly|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|paulg:  meanwhile, I expect the Scots will bid a slam here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bebechira: the rooms are not connected|pg||
nt|paulg:  Given the methods people play, I think EW are Iain Sime and John Murdoch|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:	the BBO coverage has been excellent so far, but to be honest the team has started slowly this morning.|pg||

nt|paulg:  pretty impossible for South to find that lead holding @hQJ10|pg||
nt|paulg:  I expect it will be flat|pg||

pc|c4|nt|paulg:  a normal game but will do well to overcome the 5-0 spade break|pg||

pc|h3|nt|paulg:  the three potential diamond losers suggests trying to keep the spade losers to a minimum|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  a heart finesse will protect the @dK and give another diamond discard|pg||
nt|paulg:  even when declarer plays the @sQ, he can probably still recover |pg||
nt|paulg:  West is not thinking here, he will have played the @s4 in a very even tempo|pg||
nt|paulg:  I suspect our operator is seeking advice on whether to restart|pg||
nt|vugraphzdn: some IT issues here -will give result then restart|pg||
