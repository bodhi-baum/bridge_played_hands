nt|game over: I don't know this pair very well, but I think they are always in contention for national championships in France|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  http://www.cavendishmonaco.com/index.php?option=com_bridgeresultats&view=resultats&layout=cumulrnk&rep=2013_4en&session=8&lang=en RKS1|pg||
nt|game over: East is in his early thirties I think, he was on the French Junior team for a long time|pg||
nt|game over: North's shape is a bit problematic in their system; because of the 54 major suit hands, their 1@h and 1@s openings are not 14+ plus, but can also be 11-13 with 54 in the majors|pg||
nt|game over: if North opens the hand, South will bid 2@c, 10 HCP, GF opposite 14+ (natural or bal or fit), and North has a system bid: 2@d - shows both majors|pg||
nt|game over: then South needs to decide whether to bid 2@s or 3@c - both are NF, I think he will bid 2@s because his clubs are not that good and North is likely short in clubs|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: in case not already mentioned  1@S was FORCING|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Roland reminding his listeners that our table banner is incorrect   this is session 9 of 10|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|game over: I guess WEst will open 1NT and East bids Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some would bid 2@C with east hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: in all honesty   i think i would bid 2@C intending to pass any response|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the singleton @C being Q makes  PASS more reasonable than if @Cx|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|game over: I think I would have bid Stayman as well, the East hand usually plays better in a suit contract than in a NT contract (we can see that 2@d is down)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: EW have LARGE lead in the event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: w=jagniewski|pg||
mb|1C|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: most introduced to EW during ACBL summer national when they were part of 4-man Bridge24 that won the Spingold|pg||
nt|game over: good point, the ace is technically correct in this situation, I think, the gain of a small lead comes from better communication and possible misguesses (dummy has QTx in dummy), ...|pg||
nt|game over: both not really important here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: systemically  fantunes open 1@D ONLY when 5+@D or 4441@C|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|game over: I think EW play UDCA|pg||
nt|game over: WEst will probably continue with the @h Q, but this hand is complex|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've confirmed  EW   2nd/4th leads  udca|pg||
nt|game over: the @h Q can cost a trick if partner has K-T-x-x or the ace|pg||
nt|game over: yeah, I have played several longer matches against them on BBO :) they are very tough to beat|pg||
nt|game over: both are very good cardplayers and they play a well-thought out system; their success does not come as a surprise to me at all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with Bridge24 setup they should thrive|pg||
nt|game over: from West's point of view, East having two trump tricks is his best chance|pg||
nt|game over: E/W are from poland, go to www.bridge24.net/en to learn more about them|pg||

nt|ahollan1: kit woolsey and a few other american pairs are playing suit pref at trick 1  vs suit contracts|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = forcing  14+ hcp or 11+ with @H & @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: (faking a diamond singleton) most Polish pairs play count on trick one, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 0-9 4+@S|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|game over: as described by Martens in his Guide Dog books (nice reads)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 15-18|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|game over: but I think as a developing player it is better to play suit-preference at trick one|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: interesting -	i would say easier to teach showing count|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c8|nt|game over: if EW played 2/4, I don't think West would have lead the @d 9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too many situations where 3rd hand doesn't have clear preference	new players would give away too much unauthorized info|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|game over: this is round 9, not round 8|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|ahollan1: 1N = 12-14  can include some atypical shapes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C is a relay  not pure stayman    2@S is another relay|pg||
nt|game over: what is 2@s - a puppet to 2NT? or an asking bid?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the relay structure :(|pg||
nt|game over: I am told; 2@s = Relay|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: I got several suggestions about the 2NT bid (1) Min, 2) 4333 and 3) no five-card minor)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: assuming 4@D was natural slam try    @D seems like most passive lead|pg||
nt|game over: looking at the 3NT bid (which probably shows 3334), I think 2NT = denies a five-card minor is most likely, but I don't know for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one set of explanations sent to me:   2NT = 4@C 3NT 4-333 4@D = control ask...4NT=4ctrl|pg||
pc|h8|nt|game over: after a club lead you can later endplay West for your 12th trick|pg||
nt|game over: double-dummy of course, although the club-lead might indicate clubs 5-1|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|game over: what is the best line here? If you know you have four diamond tricks, a good idea might be to play the club 10 to the queen (West would cover with the jack)|pg||
