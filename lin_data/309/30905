nt|game over: Michielsen is a top female player, originally from the Netherlands, now living in Sweden (love-related I think :))|pg||

nt|game over: diamonds he can continue with diamonds)|pg||
nt|game over: I think if West wins this trick and returns a heart, there is nothing you can play for, except maybe a singleton @s K with East and an endplay against him|pg||
nt|game over: unless hearts are frozen, i. e. WEst has @h K10|pg||
nt|medwards: Playing clubs first did not work out for the best |pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|game over: interesting hand, this is a hand where if you figure out how to make it double-dummy you might think about how you can combine the dd-solution with a single-dummy solution|pg||

pc|h2|nt|medwards: Has a play with spade queen coming down|pg||
nt|game over: probably it is best to ruff a heart and one or two spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|game over: then you will make 4 diamonds, 3 spades, two hearts, one heart ruff and two clubs|pg||

mb|1S|nt|bt:  ew probably plays the (nowadays standard) 5542 with transfer responses|pg||

nt|bobholl: you said :)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|game over: interesting 4@s bid, must be conventional|pg||
nt|game over: maybe he bid 4NT?|pg||
nt|bt:	they bid 4@H if they want to play 4@S then|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  3@H would have gained an imp ns|pg||
