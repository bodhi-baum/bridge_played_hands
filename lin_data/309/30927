pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|game over: if East has diamonds, you can probably arrange an endplay against West|pg||
nt|game over: start with the @h J|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|game over: the problem here is that East has H-x in hearts, he can win the trick and return a heart|pg||
nt|game over: the lost trick here comes back because East has H-x in hearts unless East returns a club now (not obvious) |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|game over: H = honour (the king or queen in this case (from South's point of view) we know that East has the king|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|game over: from the carding and the play, declarer "knows" that East has diamonds|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|mc|7|nt|game over: endplay West now, but can safely exit with the queen, note that this establishes a finesse against South (if he had Jxx in clubs)|pg||

qx|o13|st||md|3SA76HT75DJ84CAQ42,S854HAJ63DK93CT63,SKQ3HKQ942DAQ2CJ7,SJT92H8DT765CK985|sv|b|nt|game over: a strong French pair, West is in his early thirties, was a very good junior (and made a smooth transitiion to the open level)|pg||
nt|game over: East is a two-times European champion|pg||
nt|game over: http://www.eurobridge.org/scripts/person.aspx?qryid=679 (for East)|pg||
nt|game over: North will open 1@h = forcing, 14+ or both majors 11+, they play a weak NT, so 1NT is not an option for them|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|game over: 2@c = 10+ natural or balanced or a raise|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|game over: GF opposite 14+|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|game over: 2NT = waiting (GF), 3NT = balanced|pg||
nt|game over: (just guesses)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: 4333 opposite 5332 usually belongs in 3NT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|game over: I am told 3NT = 5332 with two clubs, 15-17|pg||
nt|game over: the reason is: you need to make two more tricks in hearts than in NT to be right to play in 4@h (in teams), in pairs it is more often correct to play in 4@h|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|game over: declarer is short of entries to his own hand, so he might try to create one by starting with the @c J|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|nt|game over: from the hesitation he knows the club finesse is on, so he has a safe line for nine tricks (two diamonds, one heart, three clubs, three spades)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  We also have voice commentary in this room.  http://webutil.bridgebase.com/v2/news_fetch.php?id=743  for instructions if you are not familiar with the voice procedure.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|mc|11|nt|game over: It is tough, but East must know at trick one what to do when declarer starts with the @c J (at the table you can usually tell from South's timing whether he has three hearts or ...|pg||
nt|game over: not; if he has three hearts, he is "short" in clubs)|pg||
pg||
qx|o14|st||md|4S96HKQJ872D3CAJ42,SJ2H5DAKT984CT753,SAKHT93DJ7652CQ96,SQT87543HA64DQCK8|sv|o|nt|game over: with long clubs and three hearts he would usually correct 3NT to 4@h|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|game over: X = negative (both minors) but West would correct 3@c to 3@d ( I think) (not that it happens here)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: 2@s = heart raise, not a generic forcing (I guess)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|game over: likely with (two or) three hearts, with more hearts he will probably "raise" with 2NT|pg||
nt|game over: declarer must be careful here, (he must start with a heart ruff, ruff diamond high, ruff a heart) don't think he will do it|pg||

nt|game over: length)|pg||

nt|game over: yes, my D-D line was for down 1 (but now he went down 2)|pg||
nt|game over: South cannot open a weak two in spades, it is 3 or pass for him|pg||
nt|game over: given this colours, it is an easy pass (he might open a 10-13 spade hand, but nah)|pg||
nt|game over: the defense against a heart contract is interesting, N/S must play a club to force East, otherwise declarer can establish the diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|game over: but then declarer can prevail by ruffing clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: now the (in)famous doctors from Germany|pg||
mb|1D|nt|game over: easily, Germany's most successful pair over the last 15 years (in German tournaments)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: 1@c is the wrong opening for West I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: well, East is a nice guy, but not at the bridge table|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|game over: 2@h = Relay (not natural)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|game over: 3@h  = natural (probably exactly 54); I am reading Jacobs' book about Fantunes' system right now, and he plays 3@d = 5@d 4@h, 3@h = 64, but they play it differently it seems|pg||
