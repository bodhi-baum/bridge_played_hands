nt|dburn:  good to be playing Precision if you keep picking up hands like this|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn:  but better to be playing natural - Precision not allowed at rubber bridge|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|Henryb:	except in set games or in China|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  I played rubber bridge in Rome in the late 1960s. The accepted standard methods were Roman Club|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:	since pass by West would be forcing, this is a strong opinion - but still not automatic for East to accept|pg||
