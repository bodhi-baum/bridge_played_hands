mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|game over: Fredin-Fallenius are two top professionals from Sweden (Fallenius lives in New York now, I think)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|game over: 1@s = forcing, 14+ or 11-13 with four hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = forcing  13+ [3rd/4th] or 11+ with @S & @H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|game over: I am glad Al is here, he knows N/S system (and all other system on the planet) very well|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = a) 14-17 HCP, nat  b) 17+ HCP, unbal|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sort of their version of Gazzilli|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D creates game force opposite the strong option|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead  good|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: club lead bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely top diamond lead   then maybe spade switch|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Tez: @d ace then @h not bad:)|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 3 down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: reverse attitude|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ady: heart is ok|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if i'm looking at correct page  top 2 spots held by polish pairs  with gap now only 430|pg||
nt|Tez: if Nunes plays @h..Fredin will take and @h ..now @s exit the best defense now|pg||
nt|Tez: @d is better.sry|pg||
nt|granguru:  y |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is final set of 10 boards for the preliminary round	tomorrow top 12 advance to bracket A  we're not 100% certain about the other 48   |pg||
pc|d7|nt|game over: the top 12 pairs will qualify for the A final (big money, the first 10 are in the money), the others will play in a B final|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|granguru:  then W after winning both @D plays @S and the defense gets one more trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: are players using bridgemate at the table to enter official scores?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D = 10-13 hcp  5+@D unbal  [6+suit or some singleton/void]|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Tez: operator help pls|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|granguru:  West surely won @DJ then @DK then played @S |pg||

mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|eamongall: oops think that is last years method |pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: from Bill Jacobs' book	RDBL =	10+ HCP, later DBLs=penalty|pg||
nt|game over: one kiebitzer suggests East is trying for 4@h X |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: EW  2M opener = 6+suit, 10-13	with 2@D covering weak hands|pg||
nt|game over: East is a known "operator" at the table|pg||
nt|game over: a very creative player|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
mc|10|nt|game over: 4@h would have been tough to beat|pg||
nt|game over: but defense can prevail by leading a heart, North must duck it|pg||
nt|Tez: 2@d 1@h 1@s lose.|pg||
nt|game over: well maybe, East can overtake and play three rounds of clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: movie now showing	21 as 4@S-2|pg||

nt|granguru:  S denies 4@h in principle|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: 5@C looks to be on for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|game over: (board 22) yes, if West plays the @h 9, North can rise and play a heart [nicely spotted by a kiebitzer)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: nothing for round 10 yet|pg||
nt|granguru:  Olanski did not open 2@s as with such a weak suit it normally helps more the opposition|pg||
mb|1D|nt|granguru:  as it *|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: some posit we won't see running scores this final set|pg||
nt|game over: bad hand, no shape, some defensive values and you don't like a lead from say @s Kx; and I like to have about five tricks given this vulnerability|pg||
nt|granguru:  transfer overcall|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|game over: might be better for security reasons to not show running scores|pg||

mc|10|nt|game over: ok, I am told 2@d just shows 17/18; if that is true then South is just looking for a 4-4 major suit fit|pg||

mc|9|nt|game over: NS will lose some IMPs here, it is very close for them, 13th place will be about 5 IMPs behind I guess|pg||
