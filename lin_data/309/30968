pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|xenya: i wonder what would have happened if W had cunningly passed|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	To beat 3@S the defence have to switch to trumps before cashing the top diamonds|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||

nt|pdjourdain:	now declarer can ruff a club but that looks to give West a second trump.. but|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pdjourdain:  Declarer can still make as West follows to 4 hearts|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bt:	with open cards it looks makeable, with good timing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant manage to get club ruff without losin2 spades unless he guesses distribution - diamond now best|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Declarer needs to reduce his trumps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|pdjourdain:  He has heart entries to ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|odysseus69: started on right track|pg||

nt|bt:	oh, he doubled, didnt notice|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	He also needs to remove East's trump before playing hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a tale-telling double i suppose|pg||
nt|bt:	I think the ew names are switched here|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Best is one trump then the hearts, then club ruff|pg||
nt|bt:	The fredin double ;)|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: But its Fallenius that Dbl|pg||
nt|cc469: W's @C3 is a pesky card|pg||
nt|bt:	Yes Mikael, thats why I thought they switched the names ;)|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Fallenius has regretted doubling in the past, particularly when the opponents passe dout a cuebid and then took the chance to change to a making grand slam|pg||
nt|bt:	That was Fredin Patrick|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|pdjourdain:  i mean Fredin|pg||

nt|bt:	very nice slam ew here, better play it in a black suit though|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|pdjourdain:  Clubs is clearly safest slam|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: need to avoid heart slam - clubs and even spades OK|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	1@H showed spades|pg||
nt|bt:	Sweden is actually a case in point. After removing the strongest pair from the team the won the Olympics (MindSportGames) first team world championship|pg||
nt|bt:	they won|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now many play that doube does not mind hearing from partner - not please shut up partner|pg||
nt|bt:	In a natural system west could confidently bid 6@C here, in Polish Club that is not possible|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Playing Polish club poor East has now shown any suit for sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: as it used to mean in past|pg||
nt|bt:	5NT as "pick a slam" would be good, dont know if it is|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5NT fom West looks reasonable - pick a slam|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	One of the theories behind Fantoni-Nunes is to get a natural suit in early whatever your strength|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	a penalty of 800 against 1370|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant imgine a pass from West|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6H or preferred 5NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: what do I know|pg||
nt|bt:	West has one of those 2% problems. 98% of your bids or plays are fairly automatic. 2% are tough and needs time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt:  IMHO of course ;)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	West has shwon his spades and doesn't know of any other fit for sure|pg||
nt|bt:	so when you encounter the 2% you should follow the advice of Tarrasch (I think), "sit on your hands"|pg||
mc|8|nt|bt:  That is, do not move until you know what to do|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	It will be interesting to see the other results on this board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am sure that East's double said I have a strong 1 club bid and equally sure that West made a poor decision - however no doubt some E-W will land in the unlucky 6 hearts|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	That is the point... north might hold 5 spades, south does hold 4 @H, E-W don't know they have nine clubs|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	5NT from West would be "pick a slam" but can he be sure they end in the right spot|pg||
