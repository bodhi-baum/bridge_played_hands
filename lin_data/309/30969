mb|4S|mb|d|nt|Fluffy: in earlier position 1@s could be considered|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|Fluffy: but favourable in third it is quite different|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fluffy: Naned doubles wishing for somehing good|pg||
nt|Fluffy: and it doesn't happen!|pg||
nt|Fluffy: double even if played more as cards it has a take out nature|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: and Gunev thinks that declaring is the best thing available, so asks Nanev to bid something|pg||
nt|Fluffy: Nanev does the best and passes|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|Fluffy: declarer seems doomed, diamonds don't break so 2@d, 1@s and 1@c gotta be lost|pg||

mc|10|nt|Fluffy: berg ended up squeezed, I think he could had avoided it winning @dA earlier|pg||
nt|Fluffy: as pointed out by kib, keeping 3@s in the end position would had been also good enough|pg||
nt|Fluffy: pitching @d10 under @hK and scoring 2@s tricks endplaying dummy instead, final positon would be @sA98 vs @sQJ4|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: a lot of total tricks means both sides might be able to make game, and the bidding will be competitive at high levels|pg||

nt|Fluffy: the 3@s bid is based on the double fit in the blacks, to tell partner we make many tricks|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Fluffy: finally the 4@c bid I have no clue what it is, but looks like Choice of Games (partner please bid the right game)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|Fluffy: 150 is not a big score|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|Fluffy: there was a -790 on last board, so 150 won't be dreadful for NS|pg||
nt|Fluffy: Fredin seems to have a good snapdragon double|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Fluffy: after the bidding starts 1 suit-another suit-a third suit, double is take-out like, showing some values (typically 8+), the 4th suit, and ability to play in partner´s suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: if north had an entry the killing defence could be a heart lead ducked around|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Fluffy: as it is now spade lead is best|pg||
nt|Fluffy: 9th trick is available only in hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: now Dubinin will have to bid spades at the 3 level if he wants to show hem|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|Mikael_W: here it looks like keep away from 6 @h and choose 6@s or 6@c instead|pg||

nt|Mikael_W: this is dangourus after 5@d, now Fredin will offcurse bid his @h|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: but opponent´s bidding doesn´t make it likely that there are good breaks around|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Mikael_W: nice, 5 nt = Pic a slam I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fluffy: this is not because the 4-1, 6@c and 6@s are better than 6@h on the long run|pg||

nt|ahollan1: buras could have held a number of other hands that gave good play for 13 tricks -- that narkiewicz couldn't learn about during auction|pg||

nt|game over: obviously, winning the whole thing adds to your vita, so it's worth more than the price money itself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  take the prize money|pg||
nt|Fluffy: I don't see that many options allan, if 2@h is 4 cards that´s very bad news, now chances of a 5th diamond go low|pg||
nt|game over: that's a good point|pg||
nt|Fluffy: and also, Narkiewicz could had used 5NT, he knows Buras has 3 aces in a 12-14 contexts, so Buras will see ANY card as extras|pg||
