mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Tez: 5/4|pg||
nt|Tez: 2@d asking long major|pg||
nt|Fluffy: fantoni's 2@d is a beginning of an invitation in case Nunes had 5@s then|pg||
mb|3S|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fluffy: fanotni was looking for game in his side a moment ago, defending a vulenrable 3NT might not be on the top of what he expected next|pg||
nt|Fluffy: look that 3@h is a cuebid, and it shows heart values|pg||
nt|Fluffy: when opponents show 2 suits most natural approach is to bid the suit you do stop|pg||
nt|Fluffy: some people like to bid one asking for things, but as a principle you should show rather than ask on this game when you can|pg||
mb|p|pc|s7|pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Fluffy: @s lead gives a 9th trick, later @dK is 10th, and lucky @dJ fall is 11th|pg||

nt|danilo1: I am pretty sure that 3@H shows not only values in @H, but @C feature as well (logical for every good pair)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Tez: @d ace and @s..no entry for @c's or @d |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
mc|9|nt|Tez: undo |pg||
nt|Tez: he cashed @c tricks|pg||
nt|Tez: if he play Q of @d first trick..if @c's are 4/0..he will go down|pg||

nt|Fluffy: oh here comes the spannish Master|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Tez: 7@c easy for us:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Fluffy: Piedra and Lantaron are not a regular pair, might not be fully prepared against NS system|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3S|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Tez: they will stop 6@c i thk|pg||
nt|danilo1: I do not believe they will miss 7 after 4@S|pg||
nt|medwards: I agree|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|danilo1: 5@H now should fix @S void|pg||
nt|Fluffy: I wasn´t expect 4NT from north|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|danilo1: 5NT?|pg||
nt|Fluffy: you have a void, partner might have another, this doesn´t seem like a hand for aces|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I'll explain the auction....|pg||
nt|danilo1: but it is possible that 5@S have diffent meaning than just a cue (would have no sense)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 4NT = even   of keycards (0 is an even  )|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 5@D says they have all they keycards|pg||
nt|Fluffy: thanks jari|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 5@H is 2nd round control, as is 5@S|pg||
nt|Fluffy: is 4@s asking directly then or had fantoni a negative bid available?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Fantoni now knows either A: They are missing 2 aces and Nunes has lost his mind or B: He needs the K@D for 7 :)|pg||
nt|danilo1: how is possible for South to force to hear @D control?|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: He can bid 5@C to sign off over 4@S|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: He can't force to hear @D control, however if you play their system, you can see how it works here, Fulvio should know|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: And apparently he did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Tez: wd|pg||
nt|Fluffy: a saving in 7M is too expensive depending on how many ruffs ¨NS manage|pg||
pc|c2|mc|13|nt|danilo1: I do not believe 4NT had anything to do with Turbo (would have little sense in this board) ... rather contra-cue-bid in @S ... so 5@D/@H/S were cues (5@S is void)|pg||

nt|Tez: 7M is looks like 2000 with ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|1H|nt|Tez: some spec says 2600:)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Over 5@S, he could show K@D and deny Q@C if he wanted, but with both cards he just bid 7@C|pg||
nt|danilo1: explanation from Spectator that looks logical: "4@S showed void otherwise 4@D@H cueb, 4nt turbo then 5@S asks for @D ctr"|pg||
nt|Tez: lucky hand 4@s makeable with open cards|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Tez: @d ruff.3@s only|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Tez: 21 point balanced against semibalance..4@s easy to make|pg||
nt|Tez: very hard to bid|pg||

nt|Tez: 1@c or 3@c or pass?|pg||
nt|Tez: with east|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I like 3@C|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: It's really only a 7 count, and with nothing in the majors i'd like to try to shutout the opponents if I can.|pg||
nt|Tez: hey you!! specs help me pls:)|pg||
nt|Tez: a lot of specs opening 4@c..i didnt write it|pg||
nt|danilo1: 1@C ... 2 side Kings (4 controls) are clearly against preempt |pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I would prefer 4@C a lot more in 1st seat than 2nd seat, I'd be too worried of preempting my partner.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|BridgeGoth: it appears 2@H is the limit for N/S and 4@C is the limit for E/W|pg||

nt|danilo1: *@C single|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|BridgeGoth: I think Nunes bids 3@H over 3@C knowing him|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|Tez: well defended|pg||
pc|c9|nt|danilo1: too risky 3@H (bad @CKQ) ... at best, he is closing 6@H tricks and brings only one trick more, voulnerable and West shown strenght and probable miss-fit|pg||
nt|danilo1: ... so, eben Nunes gave up :)|pg||
