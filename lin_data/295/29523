nt|buckbanzai:	IMHBAICO, it is very unlikely that par is 8 tricks in NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|buckbanzai:  i mean, fro the S point of view|pg||
nt|buckbanzai:	W might have been more active here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|mc|9|nt|reisig: OK ..not a silly lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: back soon -- thanks to the commentators|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: he claimed nine but they may well correct|pg||
nt|buckbanzai:	defensive trick compression is well underway|pg||
nt|buckbanzai:	trick One is a very unusual moment for that |pg||

mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:	game is good here, though not in NT's. In the other room Wold bid 2C then 2N, which looks weird to me (by S).|pg||
nt|chip:  2H bid might nudge EW to 3N. now on H lead W will have to judge to win A to switch to D's.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: if I were throwing in a lead direct with west hand, I guess I would try 2@D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: specs asking   after 2@H   a)  do you always bid 2@S with 4  b) with 4@H do you DBL|pg||
nt|chip:  Works much better to bid the suit the opponents have stopped, then attractive for them to bid 3N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|chip:  Also hard to know off a suit other than the one they bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: that seems to have worked Chip|pg||
