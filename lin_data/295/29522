nt|Allan Falk: returns as compensation.  You do have to bid 3 steps higher to break a relay--1 or 2 steps allow(s) double and pass to keep the relay going. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  It may surprise some of the kibs to know that the first coherent strong club system was developed way back in the 50's by Howard Schenken.|pg||
nt|Allan Falk: On a non-heart lead, I predict declarer will cash top clubs to see if thee queen drops, then fall back on the heart finesse.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: many of the latter bids were cue bids; 4N showed continued interest in slam;  5@D said no interest in anything higher|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Thanks again to Joe Stokes for those systemic insights|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Zwerling is saying they might have had a misunderstanding after the 4@H lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: short break before the lead|pg||

nt|Allan Falk: systems:  Blue Team Club, Neapolitan Club, Arno (Little Roman) and maybe others.  All were obviously quite playable--13 world championships in 15 years starting in the 1950s|pg||
