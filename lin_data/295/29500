mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I'ma Dutch guy, living in Poland, so not too biased :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: Interestign deal, I count 12 tricks for EW in NoTrumps|pg||
nt|rhelle: and there is a sure double squeeze for 13 tricks - unless they lead a @s|pg||
mb|5N|nt|rhelle: but even then, South will feel the pressure when East runs the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: So you cash both @s honours, @dA, run the minors|pg||
nt|rhelle: Take the @h AK, and then play the last minor winner|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: But in the meantime ... you see that North follows to 2@s, you see he has 4@d and 5@c|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: well bid by the girls! 7NT is in practice cold|pg||
nt|rhelle: because of the count on the North hand, you know the @h finesse works|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear the other table is in 7NT as well|pg||

nt|rhelle: West is a far more experienced player that East - so in a sense the contract is in the wrong hand|pg||
