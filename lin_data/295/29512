mb|4C|mb|p|nt|joest:  east never peeped and Passell had several chances to lead spades and never did|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest:  east-west could have done serious damage to that contract!|pg||
nt|joest:  then of course there is the posibility of opening 1NT :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: okay says north|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  everything sits quite nicely i would say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [assuming you open 1N] with all points in the reds -- do you rebid 3@S or 3N over 3@C?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: ruling out 3@H which implies worried about @D|pg||
nt|joest:  I might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: what would 4 spades right away over 3 clubs would show   response good trumps|pg||
nt|joest:  I would stay off 4@s nomatter what my hand to be honest|pg||

mb|3D|an|3 spades Max|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pbundy: assuming that they ultimately use some sort of ace asking - unlikely to get to slam.  they'll find they are off 2 keycards|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|pbundy: when i first learned keycard, my partners and i kept on getting it wrong.....|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|pbundy: of course, after the diamond double, n/s now hoping that they can make game!|pg||
nt|pbundy: give west AQ of diamonds with length and carolyn with Kxx of spades - they'd be down in 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: BUT - we'd get to slam on a hook (that made) or they wouldn't cash their two aces.... we thought that this keycard was quite slick!|pg||

mb|2S|nt|joest:  several ways for Wold to go|pg||
nt|joest:  2@s seems most practical|pg||
nt|ahollan1: notice 2@C with only 3@D IS allowed with specifically 1435|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: some pairs will also allow 1444 to rebid 2@C|pg||
