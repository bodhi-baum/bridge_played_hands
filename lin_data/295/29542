nt|Vugraphzfb: Feldman says that he doesn't think that 4@d could ever be last train when he'd opened a strong club and partner had splintered|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Hayden asked Feldman about 2N. Feldman wrote: "I expect he has minors, but no agreement"|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|3for3:  while he does have some potnetial in the minors, remember he was sitting on a large lead.  If the opponents think they can make 7@H, they can almost certainly make 61H and he has a good save against that....|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: careless -- now needs a trump coup, and I think defenders can break that up|pg||
nt|sixela: now a d and it can't be beaten|pg||
nt|scotty: This play was natural - if a stiff club had been led declarer needed to draw trump immediately if E had @SJxxx|pg||

nt|sixela: doesnt help|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|kit: are you sure?|pg||
nt|sixela: mike is right|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|scotty: Unless you have some weird trump endplay problem - 1-suit squeeze type|pg||
nt|sixela: but, must guess the minor length|pg||
nt|scotty: No, it looks ok for declarer...|pg||
nt|chip:  Yes, can end with high cross ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: he needs to (I think) ruff heart, cross to diamond, spade to 9, queen of diamonds pitching ace of clubs, queen of clubs, ruff club with ace of spades|pg||
nt|chip:  no guess in the minors, since think if E were 5-2-(4-2) could throw from his 2 and beat it.|pg||
