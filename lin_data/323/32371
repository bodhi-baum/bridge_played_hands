nt|paulg:  declarer has a bit to do here ... some clubs to deal with|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D not only reflects the lead you want, but it may provide an easier rebid in certain auctions, for example if W makes a negative double	in somecompetitivesequences|pg||
nt|paulg:  Paske wants to switch to a trump but concerned partner may have @hQxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it is fairly clear for N to say X over 3D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: his offense-to-defense ratio is quite low,and he iscertainly maximal foramere 2H raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D by W was, in my view, asking for trouble. i think there is just not enough to gain by the bid to risk its downsides|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: a hand with ten losers has pretty much spoken its piece (and then some) with a raise to 2D|pg||
