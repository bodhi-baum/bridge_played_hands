mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Four experienced and talented young players, but new partnerships|pg||
nt|paulg:  Did Morgan really open 1@s?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Systems available from http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwoc/bw.cgi?club=nibuimm&pid=display_page3|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|6D!|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:	I think we have missed an initial 1@h bid and West is playing 6@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has shown an odd number of key cards and diamond void with 6@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  This will make it difficult for our operator to lead the right card, but he can recover by just 'filling in' the first trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Board out of rotation but team agreed to leave it.  1h initial bid by W|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: lad 5h|pg||
nt|paulg:  Thanks Martin, they are just trying to make it difficult for you!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: iz this tu|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Bid this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Liz cannot type!!|pg||
nt|paulg:  ah, hi Liz|pg||
nt|paulg:  not an easy hand to play|pg||
nt|paulg:  entries are thin on the ground and trumps 3-1 makes things awkward|pg||
nt|paulg:  the heart lead forces a decision at trick one|pg||
nt|paulg:  but often you only do this when you hold the card in question|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: long think by declarer|pg||
nt|paulg:  we will get many long thinks by Scottish declarers at this table|pg||
nt|paulg:  I have dual loyalties in this match, although I do more work with the Scottish junior teams|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  welcome Cliff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand is being played the wrong way around and, in the confusion, our operator missed the initial 1@h opening bid|pg||
nt|capercliff:	i was saying to a Kib that this was a curious auction|pg||
nt|shengabus:  1@h - 1@s - 4@d (splinter) - 4NT (KC) - 6@d (void) - 6@s probably.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Sorry about vugraph on this hand will make sure next one is correct.|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think North still holds the @hK since declarer did not finesse on the first round|pg||
nt|capercliff:	its also a rather curious hand to play|pg||

nt|paulg:  hard for North to pass 3@s but this game should fail by a trick if the defence is careful|pg||
nt|paulg:  a ruff and discard would give up two tricks and the game here|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Dangerous choice of second heart from East -- could west think partner has three?|pg||
nt|capercliff:	with the South cards in view I dare say it will be impossible to make|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h3|pc|sK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|paulg:  apparently they lead low from odd and high from even in partner's suit, which is not what happened!|pg||
nt|capercliff:	and also 3@s must be limited|pg||
nt|capercliff:	when you have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|paulg:  very true|pg||
nt|paulg:  as I said right at the start, four very talented players but I'm not sure they've played a board together before today|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I expect a lot of bid first, think later|pg||
nt|paulg:  a philosophy that seems to be in play at the other table I'm told, where they've bid 7@s on the first board|pg||
