nt|diana_eva:  Hi Bill|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|pitiful:  Roy Welland taking a slightly unusual expert approach on the south cards i would say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  hi Bill|pg||
nt|athene: interesting double-then-cue from Welland; most would go double-then-spades, or even just a demure 1@S over 1@D|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps this is a consequence of the (very) low lower limit for his simple overcall|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|pitiful:	i think he just views the game a little differently |pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: or perhaps 2@C shows values - do they play some sort of Herbert after the double? not many do these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|pitiful:  4@d a sort of blumher bid|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i have some great cards|pg||
nt|athene: "Bluhmer" is a sort of reverse splinter |pg||
nt|athene: you jump in a suit saying "partner, if you have a singleton here, my hand is good"|pg||
nt|athene: so typically you jump in xxx|pg||

nt|athene: then run spades, and now east DOES get strip-squeezed|pg||
nt|pitiful:  doesn't seem to lose much by playing a heart from dummy early|pg||
nt|athene: dummy comes down to @HQ @CK10 and you can throw east in if he keeps @HA @CJx|pg||

nt|athene: e.g Raptor, Gladiator|pg||
mb|2C!|an|no agreement, but not natural|nt|pitiful:  at the other table e-w got their wires crossed as to the manoing of a double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  meaning|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: yes, double of 3@H was clearly intended as a game-try in spades|pg||
nt|athene: and taken as penalty|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: no idea what 2@c shows here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|athene: it's an "invisible cue-bid" i.e. east showed clubs and a major |pg||
nt|athene: my guess is it shows a good diamond raise|pg||
nt|athene: because 1@D tends to be 5+ for NS, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well 3@s is high enough for e-w|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe east was taking 3@S as pass-or-correct|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well west could have bid 2@s earlier|pg||
nt|athene: the general uncertainty as to east's major seems to have confused all four players for the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|pitiful:  buy maybe that was p/c as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 2@d was available to ask for the Major|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: maybe sabine should have done something over 3@C|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: if she just bids 3@D showing extra shape, then welland might feel he has enough of a safety-net in diamonds to try 3@H|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: knowing they can go back to diamonds if north really hates hearts|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well 4@h should go down in theory|pg||
nt|athene: funny how both north and west decided to show a fit for partner's minor, eschewing their own 5-card major|pg||
nt|athene: neither decision really bonkers|pg||

nt|athene: east opened clubs and raised spades|pg||
nt|athene: so if you think he has some hearts to pass the double, he hasn't got a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @DKx doesn't leap out as a good lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|pitiful:  looks like Roy didn't have a weak 2@d available|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe a bit rich for 3@d in second seat|pg||
nt|Harmon: they play flannery|pg||
nt|athene: sabine debating between double and 1NT?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: ok, well this answers the question from board 20 - no, they don't play Herbert|pg||
nt|athene: (i.e. 2@C after partner doubles 1@D for takeout doesn't show values)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pitiful:  i would expect double to be more popular|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: i suppose he thinks it is quite likely dummy has four hearts, which makes the underlead fractionally more appealing|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: yes, his partner showed a good hand, but it's a bit of a gamble to bid a 4-card minor at the 3-level when partner doesn't really have to have four of them|pg||
