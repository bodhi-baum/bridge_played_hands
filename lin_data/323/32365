nt|mug: on this one looks like English East was too casual with his heart return, played back @H2 instead of original fourth-highest @H3|pg||
nt|mug: and confused West|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: this board shows, again, that KJx is a fragile stopper, even if it looks resistant|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: 2@C is game forcing. Difficult for South not to bid 3NT with @HKJx|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mug: didn't have to bid it immediately|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:	Michael and Toby play transfer responses to 1@c, so 1@d shows 4+ hearts and 2@H is a "raise"|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: Hi Paul|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: Re-opening the dead auction comes quite late in a bridge player's education - North should really bid 2S here since EW have a known 8-card fit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|paulg:  I think North should really bid on the first round, after all she would have doubled if West had responded 1@H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you just need to decide whether double of 1@d or bidding 1@h means the same thing|pg||

nt|paulg:  Some of the partnerships we'll see this weekend will be inexperienced, so may not have discussed everything|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|paulg:  1@d shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|2N|mb|d!|nt|paulg:  a natural 2NT overcall is not something I've seen for a couple of years (since I persuaded my wife to give it up)|pg||
nt|paulg:  or perhaps it is the lower two suits?|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Their card does say Unusual 2NT, so this should be showing hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: An intereting double from East - guess he has not seen this situation before either|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Now what?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|paulg:  presumably hoping his partner has both minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|paulg:  West will bid 3NT presumably and North will express an opinion|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think he is worth a repeat opinion - always nice to have three trump tricks|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulg:  4@h is going to play a lot better than 3NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like -2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Sorry - keep forgetting that North is a she|pg||
nt|paulg:  I presume North is trying to put all her remaining double cards on the tray|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Is anybody there?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Director required for a ruling|pg||
nt|paulg:  Did North forget to double and want it back?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Had to go upstairs to get director|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Directors are a bit like the Number 3 Bus - only around when not required|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: One director, 2 rooms; 1 up, 1 down stairs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ah - I do not think West really wanted his bid back. |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  One kib has suggested that North may not have seen the 1@d opening initially|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: The initial double may have sown confusion - but I would not argue with a partner who wanted to play in hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  no, especially when you've already shown 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  but we don't know what has been happening and perhaps there have been different explanations or misbids confusing things|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  to be fair, the West hand is considerably stronger than the average 2@c rebid|pg||
