nt|trotto: some people in Poland call the 500-score as "Highlander"|pg||
nt|trotto: Genesis is very simple: at the time of 2nd World War there were 500 bills with Highlander image on it. |pg||
nt|trotto: it's very similar to american slang, for example: Americans call 1600 score as "White House" - a quick competition: does anybody know why? |pg||
