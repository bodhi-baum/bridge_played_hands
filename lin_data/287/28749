mb|3H!|nt|kit: Weinstein will be considering slam possibilities after 2NT rebid|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  first hand out is potential slam hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 6@D is a fair contract, and makes on lie of cards.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|CorpLaw:  6D needs 3-3 spades (or J10 doubleton, or player with 4 spades having 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: here we go for the last 30 boards of USA 2 Trials|pg||
nt|kit: or verious squeeze possibilities -- but can't combine everything|pg||
nt|kit: or West with Jx or 10x of spades|pg||
nt|warrens:  Karen, I believe that 3@H is a @S transfer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: i can not read the notes :(|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  yes, if plays restricted choice will lose to J10x in W, and gain if Jx or 10x|pg||
nt|kit: so I don't think he will ever try for the 4 spades and 3 diamonds in same hand variation.|pg||
nt|kit: Slam missed in other room, so Nickell has a chance for a jump start.|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kit: Pick a slam -- any pick will work.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|CorpLaw:  not a great slam, but will make|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein doesn't pick diamonds himself as he is concerned about protecting potential tenaces in hearts or clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Levin has neither, so he properly chooses diamonds.  Well bid.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzff: bobby says didnt like his 2 of spades|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:  With the @s9, slam is reasonable -- Certainly a good prospect at this point in the match.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: leads 3/5 std carding|pg||
nt|kit: I think right line is to duck first trick, and eventually draw trumps, ruff a heart, and play for combined spades coming in and heart-spade squeeze.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asks about  lead - 4th best. And Smith only at trick 2, regular Smith|pg||
nt|barnets: it seemed he played the !9 immediately he always does|pg||
nt|barnets: the @D9 is the curse of Scotland|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so good - a spade lead might have worked better in knocking out an entry to hearts - maybe declarer should play the jack from dummy|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Falsecard in diamonds ... Willenken concealing @d2|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Does Rodwell know diamond honors split by no honor now from South?|pg||

nt|prospero1:  the @d2 appears, now that the suit is revealed|pg||

nt|barnets: if he plays @HA and a heart North can play the @SQ|pg||
nt|me argent: carefull play should see rod home|pg||

nt|barnets: what can he do now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "sorry"|pg||
nt|me argent: rod cannot afford 2 @H plays|pg||

nt|prospero1:  He also has 33 clubs available, but timing is difficult|pg||
nt|me argent: @H10 pitching @C?|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say @H10  to the K north plays @SQ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Maybe @hT, pirching a spade|pg||

nt|dburn: better play ace and ten, just to force two discards from South|pg||
nt|dburn: but the ten first is OK also as things are|pg||

nt|barnets: from dummy on the 3 hearts|pg||

pc|hT|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|barnets: I think playng @HA and a heart was the key play|pg||
nt|barnets: forcing the diamond discard from south|pg||
nt|dburn: didn't matter - clubs are just frozen for the defenders, neither of whom can lead nor pitch one|pg||
nt|warrens:  if North plays a @H, S discards a @S and south can play Ace and a @S OR a low @S to make it|pg||
nt|dburn: trouble is, neither can they both keep two of them, because sooner or later they will be on lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  best would be for South to discard a @C to try to trick declarer|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzff: lots of thunder and lightening|pg||
nt|kit: gonna be a lot of bidding on this hand.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: North likely 4@S, and East will try 5@C.  Then it's all anybody's guess.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|kit: Likely 5@S doubles -- which goes down if defense gets off 2 rounds of trumps.|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|kit: Fleisher will get a second chance if doesn't lead a trump immediately.|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|mtvesuvius:  Is there a danger of a double squeeze, given the two forced trump returns?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kit: certainly not if first heart is ducked.  And probably not anyway.|pg||
nt|kit: very key discarding if he ruffs clubs -- West must keep discarding hearts, so declarer can't get the heart trick.  Otherwise, declarer would gat 10 trump tricks and a heart trick.|pg||
nt|kit: So he does have to win first round of hearts, for sure.  Now does the squeeze operate?|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  surely W would win first heart to play trump if given that chance|pg||
nt|sixela: no squeeze, west is never thretened|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think it works.  But the key is that West can't afford to be left with a losing heart if declarer ruffs 4 clubs in his hand.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Willenken: "could we get more?" Rosenberg: "I had a doubleton heart" W: "did you high/low?" R: "no"|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, but a piece of good luck for Fleisher - true, they needed some|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell: "couldn't have a stiff heart, could you? .... you did show me some respect though" Rosenberg: "if I had 6 clubs I would have doubled you, I guarantee it"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|dburn: but the important thing was to stop the momentum - if that had made...|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2@h here should be like new minor|pg||
nt|robinswr: keeps the bidding low which is what you usually want|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Meck & Willenken are writing notes, but we've run out of good BBO pens (they sent us a HUGE box, but the players seem to like the pens and they disappear) so I can't read|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn: this isn't the easiest slam to bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think that Rosenberg wrote that 3@c was just 4th suit forcing, but not sure|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|dburn: but South has so many points that I guess he'll eventually push North into something|pg||
nt|barnets: south bid 4N in closed now|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|me argent: natural|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe - 4NT over 3@c would be natural, but this sounds more like Blackwood|pg||
nt|robinswr: unclear. If 4@h is keycard for diamonds then 4nt is natural|pg||
nt|me argent: i meant over 3@Cs|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: well  bid|pg||
nt|dburn: well, either it was natural or Rosenberg has shown twelve key cards|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|robinswr: always good to discuss the auction with the oppoents after its over so they won't have any misinformation|pg||
nt|robinswr: like what happened in the Roy Wellend match|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer can't claim - if diamonds are 5-0 and East returns a heart, he won't make|pg||
nt|dburn: so he has to sit there for a bit while East fumes at the possibility that West rather than South has the stiff @dK|pg||
nt|barnets: commentators discussing an over my shoulder idead for players|pg||
nt|barnets: this was done on British national tv|pg||
