nt|warrens:  keep in mind that East is a passed hand, so he can't have a lot more|pg||

nt|debrose: I don't know that it isn't, but if we bid a natural 2@H, a raise to 3@H wouldn't be forcing, so I'm not sure why this is necessarily|pg||

nt|robinswr: i wonder if they have understandings on how to support hearts here|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|debrose: Flannery is a 2@D opening to show 4 spades and 5 (or 6) hearts, with minimum opening bid strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: I'm SURE they have understandings on how to support hearts|pg||

nt|debrose: I don't know what this pair's agreement is|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s would be forcing, so if you had a spade slam try you could start with that|pg||
nt|debrose: Many would treat both 4@C and 4@D as control bids for hearts, just giving up on those natural bids|pg||

nt|debrose: Even if West would act again with a minimum 5-4-3-1, he would presumably double 2@C, not bid 2@H|pg||

mc|12|nt|robinswr: good guess|pg||
