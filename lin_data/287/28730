nt|sixela: 4H would have made life a lot tougher for EW|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: sort |pg||
nt|dbl me:  E didn't need much goading|pg||
nt|sixela: 5d makes without a low spade lead, which is hard to do even when you think it is right|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dbl me:  Is it possible that over 1S, 4h might have been a splinter (not best IMO)?|pg||

mb|p|nt|gab7nt:  I am not sure they play this pass as forcing, as Michael competed over a same-level bid|pg||
nt|HedyG:  is it really necessary to show the minors when he has fit in @H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Katz asks about 4NT, and Fleisher makes a "rolling on" gesture|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I don't think 4NT was minors - I think it was a choice between red suits|pg||
nt|dbl me:  N may be as concerned about opps' 5 bid as vice-versa|pg||
nt|gab7nt:  I think east now has a clear small spade lead but may elect to bid 5S|pg||

nt|barnets: spade ace underled by Katz !|pg||
nt|debrose: Voice commentators are talking about 4N as if it's clearly an option, but I think most would play it as Keycard for hearts in this auction|pg||

pc|h6|nt|dbl me:  It is common to lead yr short suit holding a trump stack, hoping to tap yourself out of trump endplays.|pg||

nt|kit: I'm sure he is ruffing and leading a heart -- then dummy's 8 of spades comes into play and there will be nothing the defense can do.|pg||

nt|debrose: So it's not clear you want to save, but given that, as Adam said, the save may well make........|pg||
nt|kit: But North will be bidding 3@H I think.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	Declarer does have to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy, but the @DA lead in the other room made his job easier.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Drewsky: Unlucky for east in the open room that he found the only lead to allow 4@H doubled to make....the ace of @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  1@D is an unappealing opening bid for me.  I would prefer either 3@D or a waek 2@D (if available).|pg||
nt|kit: quite the difference of opinion in the two rooms -- and, as is often the case, it is a bidder's game.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson:  After 3@D pass 3NT, North would have a difficult choice.|pg||
nt|kit: oh sorry, he did bid 3@H -- never mind.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: This is the normal looking lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	On this lead, the defense will be able to prevent declarer from scoring two ruffs in dummy, leaving him with 4 losers.|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes, just as the @DA was the normal looking lead in the other room|pg||
nt|kit: So on a trump shift later, looks like all declarer can take is 6 heart tricks and 3 spade tricks.|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|swanson:  not forced to game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius:  There is a lot of work for declarer in 4@s.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn: 3NT more likely final contract, I think|pg||
nt|barnets: that will make easier|pg||
nt|barnets: Declarer went down in 3@S after the @DJ lead|pg||
nt|barnets: he did not play the hand to best advantage|pg||
nt|kit: This looks one of those games you just bid and hope for a decent mesh.|pg||
nt|kit: In fact, I believe 4@S just might come home, with jack of diamonds and ace of hearts both onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 2N passable or does sequence force to 3@S?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	South is extremely likely to have all three aces, so even if the DJ were offside, declarer would still have plenty of chances to make.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, the jack from jack-third rather misled him - he ruffed a diamond high at some point, thus generating a trump loser and not solving many of his other problems|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: So in principle he might score 5 spades, 2 hearts, 1 club, 2 diamond.  Of course, he might not play for this.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: This gets the 2 diamond tricks quickly -- low from dummy, and South will have to take ace as his partner might have Kxx.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	With 2 diamond tricks in the bag, declarer won't even need a ruff.|pg||
nt|kit: So two heart leads from dummy will do it, provided declarer can avoid a trump promotion|pg||
nt|kit: Even if South pluts in 8 of diamonds, declarer can win and lead a diamond to the 10 safely enough.|pg||
nt|barnets: soutH best to win @DA play @CA and a club|pg||
nt|barnets: while holding @HA|pg||
nt|kit: That would be pretty double-dummy -- North might have queen of clubs.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it is open to declarer to unblock @dK if South plays the ace|pg||
nt|barnets: then he can win the @HA and play a third club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	Declarer only needs 2 dummy entries, with the diamonds coming in for a pitch.|pg||
nt|kit: right, but if uses the spade entries there may be trump promotion dangers.|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|kit: If he plays spade to jack now, he is down.	I'm not sure he can survive.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	When declarer plays a spade to the jack finding out about 4-1@s, he'll have to play a heart from dummy, fearing a trump promotion.|pg||

nt|kit: The should certainly get to the small.	And maybe the grand.  And knowing the king of clubs onside helps.|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mtvesuvius:  West certainly will bid again regardless of East's thinking, but it feels like 6@s is a bit much unless 4@s did show some interest.|pg||

nt|dburn: a sensible way to play in this kind of auction (and in several others) is that pass shows the best hand or the worst hand, other bids show medium hands (and are descriptive)|pg||

nt|adamw:  Kit, I wasn't suggesting that West does or doesn't have a clear call, but rather than it doesn't do us much good to speculate without knowing what 4@s meant.|pg||
nt|kit: right Adam.  But what I am saying is that IF 4@S shows the worst, then my judgement with the West hand would be to quit.|pg||

nt|kit: only two pickups for Fleisher, but they were big ones -- enough to give them a small lead.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dburn: good effort by East-West at the other table to avoid 3NT - must have been miffed to find it would have made|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	The 1@h overcall often sucessfully keeps the opponents out of a making 3N.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Trials Committees are done telephonically with people who have not seen the hand|pg||
nt|medwards: One heart overcall|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|kit: If you are ever going to overcall with a 4-card suit, this must be the hand for it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = a) NT bid, nothing about stopper  b) raise to 2m  c) BAL, INV|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	When the opponents go looking for a heart stopper, they will come up empty, and find themselves possibly bypassing a making 3N for an inferior contract.|pg||
nt|barnets: I claim 100 for honours !|pg||
mb|3H!|an|thumbs down|nt|kit: E-W do well to double this, but that is difficult to find.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: good to see you still spelling words properly, Barnet, despite all those years in the colonies|pg||
nt|kit: Now 4@D, and will East bid the fifth?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  is this a 2-card DBL situation?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphzff: shrug by chris|pg||
nt|sixela: i think it is right if you understand it to be balanced 18-19, just tough to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: no, only at 2-level|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kit: not obvious to me why West bid 4@C instead of 4@D |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: seems rather a lot|pg||

nt|sixela: sometimes it is not good to trust the oppon's bidding too mch|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius:	Willenken envisioning a singleton heart.|pg||
nt|medwards: Yes!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: "partner must have a singleton..."|pg||
nt|kit: West "knew" his partner had a stiff heart.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sixela: always better to let pd bid his own singleton|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, partner could have bid 4@h with a singleton perhaps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||

nt|ahollan1: so what is default meaning of East DBL of 3@H??|pg||

mb|2H|nt|barnets: if the players often overcall 4 card suits as they do perhaps he should not think a sing heart is guaranteed|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: with carefull play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	Yeah, the schedule was moved backward by 2 hours, so we're 12 minutes into the usual 15 minute break between sets.|pg||
nt|dburn: better play them now|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius:	However the timing is probably far more relaxed, given only one match is in play.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: here comes Chris|pg||
nt|sixela: yes, but then def can counter by tapping dummy|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, this is a decent save (doubtless to EOK's disgust), but overcalling two of a minor on five works sometimes|pg||
nt|dburn: especially over 1@d, be it said|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: he has crossed his arms|pg||
nt|dburn: that will make it awkward for him to play a card|pg||
nt|medwards: Soloway said that two clubs over  one diamond was a very destructive bid|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 4 heart tricks and 5 club tricks anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: seems right to lead @hQ now - South ought to have only one club and at most two hearts|pg||
mc|10|nt|dburn: even better to claim down one|pg||
