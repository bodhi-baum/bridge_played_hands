mb|d|nt|jjsb:  this match is in the open event its a double round robin of 11 match each so this is match 8 of first round robin |pg||

nt|jjsb:  they are all "green" so we are into standard system|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jjsb:  at this first hand , note the decision by South to open this hand |pg||
pc|s6|nt|jjsb:  i admit even i understand that i have a good @c suit i will not do it ... 1@c is not at all preempting anything  so this will be for the lead and i would prefere to have 5 card for it at least with that 9HP hand |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jjsb:  im trying to find the note abou the 1@s overcall im afraid ididnt .... |pg||

pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jjsb:  declarer was probably confused , double means normally card |pg||
nt|jjsb:  so i guess with a 1@c opening North is not suppose to have card so he is wondering who "lied" there |pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|gracelin: Zia used to do this and mentioned the trick in one of his books|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: Wonder which of north bids showed that he held HK, a card supposed to be in West hand with his double.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gracelin: the only losing option for declarer now is he plays Dawei to have Jxxxxx of Heart and decide to finesse H10 rather to ruff the 3rd one.|pg||
nt|gracelin: anyway the double of 4H by Dawei casted doubt for declarer in his play, and that's the sole purpose of the trick|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|gracelin: when trumps are 3-2, declarer can also estaliblish the 5th spade.  but if he does that and find spades to be 5-1, he maybe short of entry to finesse H10 then.|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|jjsb:  NS playing well in @h here |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jjsb:  3@c here maybe ? |pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|jjsb:  and this will probably south decide about what to do on 4@s |pg||
nt|blewah: that 3@c is music for Hiroshi's ears|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jjsb:  nice bid , notice other table it was 2@h (for @s) that didnt give a lot of room for south to enter into auction |pg||
nt|blewah: but he pass, anyway...|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jjsb:  well its probabl to bid after ... ?|pg||

nt|jjsb:  i dont see why he would not finesse in @c |pg||
nt|jjsb:  as for defense here i know a lot dont like it but in special situation like that i admit ace for attitude and k for count is fine i think |pg||
nt|blewah: EW play udca |pg||
nt|jjsb:  declarer has some option of play |pg||
nt|blewah: @s5 clearly shouts even, then, i think|pg||
nt|jjsb:  but i think the best is just simply to play k of @h and finesse then in @c |pg||
nt|jjsb:  if its UDCA definitley |pg||
nt|ssbux: but West pass on the second round and his 3S is being force by 3H, it may be difficult to visualise 4S with W|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|jjsb:  one imp difference is 9.69 for Japan and here with a possible 15imp its 13.41 if i see it correct |pg||
