nt|me argent: 4@Ss however is a different matter|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|adamw:	2@S likely just showed a fifth @S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Not sure why 2@h was alerted - I think just that it could sometimes be off shape|pg||
nt|adamw:  9 tricks with the lucky lie, except on a @C lead.|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  need to avoid club lead to make this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry   2@H = all reverses 100% force, possible singleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5+suit  does not promise another bid|pg||
nt|adamw:  Thanks Al! I remembered that one from an earlier match.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Thanks to Debbie Rosenberg for the explanation of 2@h|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1:  55	Zia gives wrong answer to PRKC	so Martel jumps to 7@C|pg||
nt|robinswr: it looks more like a notrump opener than a club heart reverse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pointed out  that with 2@D available, 2@H should be nat  and 2@D would be suspect|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  N may try to cash AK diamonds before playing spade to K, then will need to guess which suit is breaking 3-3.  may try KD to see if get count from oppt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still 100% forcing|pg||
nt|me argent: 17 hcp with 7 controls?|pg||
nt|adamw:  Wow! 2 imp loss for bidding a grand off a cashing ace.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Rodwell asks about 2NT rebid and Rosenberg says it's standard. Rodwell: "17-18?" Willenken: "whatever you thinnk is standard" Rodwell: "just some people reverse lighter"|pg||
nt|adamw:  Rosenberg does not know what to make of the lead.|pg||
nt|adamw:  It gives him the contract if Rodwell has @S QJTx, but he doesn't expect that.|pg||
nt|robinswr: queen is short spades?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  lead may cause N to think spades aren't breaking and try to set up diamonds instead|pg||
nt|adamw:  Rodwell knew declarer could have a singleton @S.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  don't know why didn't try AKD.  if honor fell, that suit would be more promising to set up|pg||
nt|adamw:  The 9 has no cost unless East led the Q from QJxx, which he would never do.|pg||
nt|barnets: Lucky to only lose 3 imps on 7@C |pg||
nt|ahollan1: ew  honor leads   Rusinow from 4+suit else standard|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|CorpLaw:  3-3 diamonds is simple too|pg||
pc|h3|nt|adamw:  Rosenberg judged that after the opening lead it was more likely that @S were 3-3 (or QJ tight or QJTx in the East) than that diamonds were coming in.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|robinswr: so the queen of spades was from 3 or possibly from 2|pg||

mb|1D|an|3 !ss|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 11-15 hcp, 2+@D|pg||
nt|robinswr: but once no diamond honor appears, then spades is the best chance because of the openinglead|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  another 6-4 hand that N have game on if they can reach it|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 1@S tends to deny 4@H unless game force|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: DBL = 3@S|pg||
nt|adamw:  But we also make the tournament shorter for some teams by awarding byes for excellent results during the previous calendar year.|pg||
mb|r!|nt|ahollan1: Rodwell actually plays conventions that he invented -- go figure|pg||
nt|me argent: XX?|pg||
nt|robinswr: in this even two 4-person teams did very well with one of them winning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = top @H honor|pg||
nt|adamw:  Specs remind me that the Bermuda Bowl is only 48 boards per day in the KO phase, while we play 60 here.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think Rosenberg just said RDBL was 2 hearts and values, bu tnot sure|pg||
