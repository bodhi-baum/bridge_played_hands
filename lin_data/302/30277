nt|petergill: 1H - 1NT = 5+ spades|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@c was ambiguous, 2@h shows @h and @cs mini*|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ritong: i guess|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|petergill: Seems right, and 1@H - 1@S - 1NT would have been 4 spades|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|petergill: NS play Standard Count, Std signals|pg||
nt|petergill: Should he win the ace?|pg||
nt|ritong: @s J did not convince declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: Michael Rosenberg won the Best Card Player in the World competition, the last time it was held|pg||
nt|petergill: to beat 2@H, NS have to promote @H9 on spades, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: so if you win ace, play spade back ... that might work |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ritong: rosenberg can assume his @s trick will vanish on the @ds, yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|petergill: I have the advantage of knowing all 52 cards ... Michael has to consider many layouts|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|petergill: Good sneaky play by Kaz Furuta to slip @C10 through|pg||

mc|8|nt|ritong: the score does not include the five first boards|pg||
nt|petergill: If North can tell what all 52 cards are, perhaps he might have tried - win @DA, spade back, and now East might go down|pg||
