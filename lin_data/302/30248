mb|d|nt|jkdood: An action hand to start....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS play "Baltic Club"   related to, but different from Polish Club |pg||
nt|jkdood: 6S looks down 1 but might be reached and might even make|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Is there a systemic reason S is unable to bid 2S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jkdood: The 3-1 trump break is a big negative, but the A of H onside is very ehlpful, if guessed|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2@S would be non-force, but not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: still trying to find out about 2@D  [i thought it was Michaels but maybe they bid over the forcing, but not strong 1@C same as over big 1@C]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: does east hand look like a preempt?|pg||
nt|dbl me:  I bet it does to S..  :-)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jkdood: It was alerted and obviously more than a simple weak diamond hand|pg||
nt|jkdood: With 6S iffy, the sure plus (300? 500?) will not make NS too unhappy here|pg||
nt|jkdood: If I had to guess, I think 300 is most likely outcome, of course less than 450 or more NS is entitled to|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s2|nt|jkdood: But 500 surely looks possible|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jkdood: I doubt if it was extremely clear to South to leave this double in|pg||

nt|jkdood: The "treatment" will probably result in the same contract being reached|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i get carsick in back seat|pg||
nt|dbl me:  lol, good one|pg||
nt|jumpshift: South has a dilemma:  slammish cards but weak diamonds, paired with triple heart stop!|pg||
nt|jkdood: A redouble seems tempting, but knowing pard has 0/1 should discourage that call|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Maybe should, but didn't:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe the default agreement for EW  is that DBL of 'splinter'	looks for save @@ favorable vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: otherwise asks for lead of highest unbid suit|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Perhaps redouble, by agreement, is conventional and shows slam interest in a minor?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that usually applies when response shows fit to opening SUIT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Note that if S had fewer h's, it might be critical to get in a d bid before more h's are bid.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: DBL = 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: The other room started with a 2C call; so auction was much different than we will see. Welcome Barnet Shenkin!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you read bridgewinners' "In The Well" with Michael Rosenberg -- you'll know that he can open 1@C or 1@D when 4@C & 4@D|pg||
nt|barnets: Rosenberg deciding between 3 and 4 @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but he'll never reveal the algorithm to explain when he picks one over the other|pg||
nt|jkdood: First issue is he doesn't know his partner has more than 4 hearts for sure|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: how about 2@S  [assuming that wasn't already asked]|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps he chooses what he would like led sometimes|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: With xxxx   KTxx  Qxx  Qx  would there be another call besides 2H sensible?|pg||
nt|barnets: especially in third chair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: west might [keyword] bid 1N with that hand Jay|pg||
nt|barnets: so both west and east might have bid 4@H|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Vul. at imps, it's hard to imagine W passing this.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Another swing to Germany, rather large this time|pg||
nt|jumpshift: W expects the play to start with 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|jumpshift: he knows his pard doesn't have a stopper|pg||
nt|barnets: even with 8 pts in partners void|pg||
nt|barnets: game is good|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dbl me:  Cagy opening lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
nt|dbl me:  S shd avoid returning a spade lest pd assume his trumps are better.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Perhaps East should have chosen 2S rather than 3H, and upon hearing a 3H reply, raised to 4?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nah  after 2@S   Willenken jumps to 4@H|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Seems likely|pg||
nt|jkdood: So 2S has 2 ways to win |pg||
nt|dbl me:  Yes, that's true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it is worth discussing whether  Support DBL followed by Q = game force or just 1-round force|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Vul. at imps, almost academic, right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: example hands given show why 2@S is wrong IF game force|pg||
nt|barnets: it sounds like a game force to me|pg||

nt|dbl me:  absolutely|pg||
nt|jumpshift: I sympathize with W here:  hard to envision declarer started this way with @CAQxxx|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Yes, the play is premised on decl's avoidance of the club suit.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: right    my wager would be that Willenken's top 2 choices were @CJ and @S|pg||
