nt|petergill: So I agree with David|pg||
nt|dburn:  would agree, but would substitute the word "spades" for the word "flaws"|pg||
nt|bt:	1@S on the previous one has these flaws: distribution, vulnerability, strength, passed partner, does not take up bidding space, partner dont dare raise|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bt:	the advantage of 1@S is the suit quality if partner gets to lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bt:  that about sums it up|pg||
nt|petergill: The more points your side has, the more likely they are to go down, cf Bd 20, where South can pass out 1NT and collect 600 or 500 because NS have so many points and tricks and ...|pg||
nt|petergill: opponents are vul. |pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it sometimes happens that when you overcall on @sAQ10 fifth the opponents magically do not bid 1@h-2@c-2NT-3NT, down on a spade lead|pg||
nt|petergill: but there are other arguments that point in the opposite direction, of course|pg||
nt|dburn:  instead, they play some clever 5-2 heart fit and you lose a load of IMPs|pg||

nt|petergill: Tricky 4@h to play|pg||
nt|bt:	meanwhile declarer has some communication problems here|pg||
nt|petergill: Danger of club overruffs|pg||
