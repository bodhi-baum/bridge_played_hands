pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|petergill: I think North's decision to upgrade to 15, adding one point for his 5 card suit, is dubious at best, with bad pips in his long suits and a Qx of doubtful value. |pg||
nt|petergill: minus 200 is the likely outcome|pg||

nt|riccho:  decl should have settled for -1 but tried for more and was punished|pg||

nt|petergill: is stronger|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Downgrading, as Rehder did on the 2@D making 150, is rarer among experts. |pg||
mb|4H!|nt|petergill: Many experts open Robert Tobing's hand nowadays - "get in quick" is their idea|pg||
mb|5C|nt|petergill: 4@H splinter by passed hand, a little bit aggressive|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@H shows values, splinter helps North visualise short spades in South and thus some clubs in South hand, hence good 5@c bid|pg||

nt|petergill: I think on balance @HA lead is best - might even promote @CQ if hearts are 1156|pg||
mc|11|nt|petergill: The splinter had shown West's singleton heart|pg||
nt|petergill: NS system card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/WBC2013/BermudaBowl/Indonesia/asbi-tobing.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA to look at dummy, to see if dummy has 5 or 6 hearts, is possibly the best lead of the three possible leads|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: EW play Transfer Splinters in non-competitive auctions, so perhaps there was some doubt about whether 4@H showed singleton club or single @H|pg||
nt|petergill: anyway, Robert Tobing's 5@C bid struck gold - it's a bidder's game|pg||
nt|petergill: Trump lead works best|pg||

nt|petergill: If 2@s raise was weak, then 3@S (if it was a game try) was very aggressive (when playing against good defenders)|pg||
