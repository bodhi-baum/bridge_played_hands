nt|fabsayc: why did the auction die|pg||
nt|gracelin: But taken away the space for West to show his distributional hand. 4H is not enough but he has little option.|pg||
nt|gracelin: after a 3-level negative double, West needs not much to bid 4H in competitive situation.|pg||
nt|kit: Fear of the 5-level has caused many a good slam to be missed.|pg||

mb|4C|nt|kit: some artificiality here -- 6@C good contract, but bad split will create problems.|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Guess declarer can cope with the 4-0 split in 6C, he has all the winner at the side|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|gracelin: I am afraid they will bid to 7C|pg||

nt|kit: first 2 tricks will go quickly|pg||
nt|kit: and now, a lot of thought|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club to jack, keeping side communication intact|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, declarer didn't know SJ is droping, so cannot affort to play a low trump to hand.|pg||
nt|gracelin: ruffing 2 diamonds with C9 and C8, then duck CJ maybe quite safe|pg||
nt|kit: I think diamond ruff (8 of clubs), 9 of clubs, duck when split, and then ruff diamond with jack of clubs and hook|pg||
nt|kit: you beat me Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: a better approach maybe to ruff a spade, then ruff to hand and run spade to neutralize north's trump power|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seems like all lines work, even using spades as substitute trumps|pg||
nt|kit: obviously everything will work on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|kit: Our suggest line fails to 5-1 diamond split.  Is there better?|pg||
nt|gracelin: I think Chris will take the spade line to make it|pg||
nt|kit: Does that work if spades jxxx?|pg||
nt|gracelin: or he can cash both SA and SK before ruffing to make sure that spades are not 5-1|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, as long as it not 5-1, |pg||
nt|kit: I'm not sure I see how|pg||
nt|gracelin: Kit's prediction that there will be a lot of thought is very accurate|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, that part was easy :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: it may take even longer time if Rosenberg were in the driver's seat|pg||
nt|kit: Ok, AK of spades, spade ruff, spade ruff, diamond ruff, high spades does work|pg||
nt|kit: So can make if spades not 5-1.  Can make if diamonds not 5-1.  But can things be combined?|pg||
