nt|sunsamvar: low to @H10 is % play i thk|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: Duboin forces with a @S guess now|pg||
nt|brgpro: leading the @hJ wins when @h9 is onside with a @h honor, and also works when it is exactly K9 or Q9 offside|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: Actually I would have expected declarer to go up king of spades now that he knows he has 2 heart losers,|pg||
nt|kit: since if that wins, he can pitch the other spades on the diamonds.|pg||
mc|9|nt|brgpro: small to the 7 loses when K9 or Q9 offside|pg||
nt|kit: Leading jack also works on a lot of the 4-1 splits when East has 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: perfect Kit|pg||
nt|key1809: yes that was his only legitmate way to make the hand, small wd never gain|pg||
nt|gracelin: As the play went, low to 10 will succeed even if East has Q9x.  He would be endplayed in the end into leading a club|pg||

mb|p|nt|gracelin: the 4th 19-20 2C opening this set|pg||
nt|kit: lets see if they can survive this one|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: West really has a hand from Hell to lead from|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: which red suit to lead ?|pg||
nt|kit: why does it have to be a red suit?|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has enough enties to set up the long D in dummy, via the finesse of CQ, so seems no problem|pg||
nt|kit: In fact, I would probably lead king or jack of spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gracelin: With south known to have 19-20 HCP, north must have enough to raise to 3NT which leaves East a likely 0-1 HCP|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: i would have agreed completely Kit but in this case partner is not likely to have any points...|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: so no point trying to hit his suit i feel|pg||
