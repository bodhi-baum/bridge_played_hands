nt|ady: another chance for England to gain if stopping in partial|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not going to upgrade when you have no tens and 5-card suit is poor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  thought Gold was debating between 2@c and 1NT :)|pg||

nt|ady: this can be around another 7 imps for England|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  sorry with table restart we have lost scores to date|pg||
nt|paulg:  Forrester and Gold extend the concept to a 1@d opening bid too, focusing on responses that promise a 5-card major |pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  CR crashed at same time|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  for another explanation http://www.montrealrelay.com/montreal/mr.html|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looks like a lot of tables went down at the same time|pg||
nt|paulg:  the threat of a diamond ruff is clear and then a trump promotion too, although he has a club loser he can pitch on that|pg||

nt|ady: defence can take 3 hearts 3 spades 2 clubs and A@D    but dfences some times go wrong|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  only 5 on top, so will need to develop several suits|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm told Bathurst lead a spade and Bakhshi read the cards extremely well|pg||
nt|ady: would need to|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the auction did not suggests a @d lead, so declarer can place Forrester with 5@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  a spade lead is not quite as threatening as a diamond lead|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|paulg:  and South is going to be in some trouble on these hearts|pg||
