nt|Walddk2: Whether 4@C is serious or non-serious I don't know|pg||
nt|rv: too much @c wastage opposite a void|pg||
nt|rv: it looks like 4@c is non-serious and 3n would have been serious|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|rv: 4@d is last train cue bid|pg||
nt|rv: doesn't promise @d control, but shows extras and interest in slam exploration|pg||
nt|pelu:  in 6@h u need @hs 3-2 and to play @Ds for 1 loser|pg||
nt|rv: normally last train cue bid is used when person cueing is not sure about safety of 5 level|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@D could also be Kickback RKC|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: Roland is more likely, it does look like RKC and not last train|pg||
nt|rv: 5@c seems to be specific king ask, 4n would have asked for @HQ|pg||
nt|rv: Rosenberg is possibly showing no side king by jumping to 6@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: 2@C could be 2, 2@H shows 6+@H, 3@H shows support, 4@C non-serious with club cuebid, 4@D not necessarily a cue, but promises a spade control that 4@C denied|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: 4@S Weinstein said "4@S normally asks me to bid 4NT but I refused"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: we are all guessing here except Andy:)|pg||
nt|pelu:  good new for the bulgarian - 6nt made on @d-lead from N|pg||
nt|rv: maybe 4@d was actually some form of last train|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It confirmed the spade cue, Rosenberg had denied|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Michael has a habit of getting these tough decisions right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is arguably the world's best analyst, so he knows his odds in detail|pg||
nt|pelu:  DD - ruffing finess in @C = 2 discard and then duck a @s|pg||
nt|rv: he possibly knows from lead that @s are 3-3|pg||
nt|rv: that should help in his analyses|pg||
nt|rv: he will try to combine his chances, @DK well placed and if doesn't work take @c ruffing finesse?|pg||
