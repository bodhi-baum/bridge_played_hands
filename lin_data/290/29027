nt|MiniMeck: Well apparently both tables had the same snag :+) I think on this hand grandma and grandpa would have scooped the pot :p|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D =10-15 hcp, 2+@D   2@D = F1 [forcing 1 round]|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|MiniMeck: Hard to see rodwell stopping short of game here. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D from Meck is interesting ploy	 [meaning I never would have thought of it]|pg||
nt|ritong: takes the cue|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: Conventional wisdom would be to shut up as soon as possible when you open a 4-3-3-3 11, but just trying to gunk up the auction here :)|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: Seems 5@d inevitable, question will be if it gets hammered or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: upside making NS miscount the @D layout  but downside  Rodwell places Meck's @S values in red suits|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: Some specs suggesting Hamman's rule by rodwell, that is not a possibility with West's hand :+) |pg||
nt|vugraphzaf: fingers crossed on his chest, eyes closed....|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: Perhaps double by rodwell and 3nt by Jeff, that looks better but I still can't imagine rodwell sitting for that, but who knows : )|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking maybe a hedge of 4@C|pg||
mb|5D|nt|MiniMeck: Rosenberg is in 5@c doubled by east, so EW have a chance at a pickup at any rate|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: no double no trouble (3@S looks on)|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: Rodwell did well at least to completely discourage south from even considering a double here :) will earn a small pickup to end this match|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: In any case, thanks to our wonderful operator Guy LBX, and to all of my co-comentators, an awesome / interesting 10 board match :)|pg||
