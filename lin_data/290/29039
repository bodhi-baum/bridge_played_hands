nt|Walddk2: I think the falsecard implies he has Jxx else why play for it, a spectator asks me. Well, Meck's line will work if North has singleton or doubleton jack, and also when South has Jx|pg||
nt|MiniMeck: Surely Meckwell have many tools to try to sort this out at this point, Rodwell likely deciding what track to initiate|pg||
