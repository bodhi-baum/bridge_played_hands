nt|bobholl: in holland that's called "wereldconventie" world convention world meaning very good :)|pg||

mc|11|nt|ady: 5@C from south not for everbody on flat hand|pg||
nt|Henryb:  This board will possibly win the match for Poland - likely 7 imps. which would put them 6 ahead with one to play|pg||
nt|ady: had south passed north may have bid 1 more|pg||

nt|barnets: and they have defeated some of the tourneys best teams|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Before I forget it, many thanks to our BRILLIANT VG operator!|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond or a club lead beats 4@H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|barnets: a spade lead or trump lead and you make it|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|d!|nt|BroLucius:  5@D almost certain to suffer the three top losers.|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  5@d also makes on a spade or diamond lead|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  North may be tempted towards 4@H when he hears of good diamonds.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Breno needs to bid and make a game to win|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  A marvellous climax, either way. You will not find me complaining about the 28 boards span.|pg||
nt|barnets: well played match|pg||
nt|chessmaste: My guess is Italy lose on Penalties|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|barnets: I think that happened in the world cup final V brasil|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I believe the double of 1@h showed 4/5 spades and the double of 2@c showed three card support|pg||

nt|barnets: but they lose without the penalty here - I think the 6 has still to come off|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Anyway, with this result, the cell-phone penalty does not matter|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets: tks all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: traian|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  We are all a bit sad for Garozzo, but good in the end that the phone penalty did not affect the result.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  West's brave 3@H on 25 was the winning bid. Well done to him.|pg||
