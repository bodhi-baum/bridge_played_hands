nt|dburn: 2@h doubled would have been a less practical contract - surprised South coudn't double|pg||

nt|MiniMeck: trust a Bridge statistitcian such as Eric to determine that it is not a long term winner. |pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Reese, one of the conceivers of the method, admired its power in a constructive sense - dealing with many hand types. It also freed 2@H and 2@S for other usage. He did not intend the multi as obstructive primarily.  |pg||

mb|r|mb|1N|nt|BroLucius:  1NT may be minors, but still not so easy for them to get to game (East should know that North is operating by now, though).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S is a bit light, but anything goes in 3rd seat non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  He did not have your suit requirement for 2@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S would not have been better; then East bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has more than I require for 2@S, David, Q109xxx, a suit that can stand a lead from Kx|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  South led a diamond against 3NT at the other table.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  So, a big bite out of the lead.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well, 6 or 7 IMPs to Mahaffey|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk2: The difference 9 or 10 before the last board|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Two more such bites needed and only one board left.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  The English Bridge Union, a few decades ago, would have ludicrously charged South with 'fielding the psyche' by not doubling 2NT. How absurd when East had no need to make such a bid without a great hand.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|BroLucius:  They were obsessed about psyches at that time.|pg||
