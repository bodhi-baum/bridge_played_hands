mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: Small slam they will get to, probably not higher|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: a few will even advocate bidding grand slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have been in worse grands|pg||
nt|rv: Roland's slam bidding is legendary, you should not benchmark with him on that aspect of game:)|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: So has Weinstein. 7@D off @DA last year|pg||
nt|rv: possibly Nark's 3@h is splinter showing @c suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Rosenberg asks about 3@H before doubling (I couldnt hear it)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|runnerup: west has his @c support =3 @h and shorthness -east with 1 @c has only rele -maybe they can stay in 6 @s |pg||
mb|4N|nt|rv: this not a very good GS on combined hands, as Roland remarked we have all been in worse grands|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 makes with all cards in view, but at the table? I don't think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzaa: Narkiewicz was nice enough to write it down. Apparently Narkiewicz has shown (in general) a 5-1-3-4 shape  (4@C is cuebid, denies a diamond cuebid)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|6D!|mb|p|nt|rv: good rule of thumb followed by many players, never bid grand slam unless you can count 13 tricks|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|mb|7S|nt|Walddk2: 6@D probably asking for 3rd rd control|pg||

nt|runnerup: 6nt -nothing to play -may have some problems in bidding -but 1 vote for 990|pg||
nt|rv: some specs pointing out that best line of play in that 7@s was to embark on cross-ruff|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C a transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rv: it is definitely worth considering though not sure if it is best line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: aka Transfer Lebensohl or Rubensohl/Rubinsohl|pg||
nt|runnerup: dd maybe -still line taken was very normal-just endsituation missed|pg||
nt|rv: 3@c shows @ds, Invitational+ strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is perhaps too scientific for some. 18 count, partner opened a 15-17 NT. Bid 6NT, you can't be missing AK in a suit|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: I presume Rosenberg thinking of how to explore for GS, ideally he would like to ask aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I should not have yelled|pg||
nt|rv: new partnership, he ppossibly doesn't have too much science and finally made a practical bid|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein held as little as @SKX, @HAXX, @DAXX, @CKXXXX  it would be good GS|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: suppose Rosenberg didn't have methods to set suit or even ask aces after this start to auction|pg||
nt|runnerup: first show -all in table -you have a suit -then --sorry 6nt --point missed -but maybe if south has some big @d support ..|pg||
