nt|dburn: not at all sure about this, though|pg||
nt|dburn: he went right in spades, but control is now an issue|pg||
pc|s5|nt|georgia19: the hand on lead v 3NT in other room had no reason to lead a heart and it rolled home, is this a good method?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|dburn: declarer is of course just relying on the diamond finesse, which worked once...|pg||

nt|dburn: denies four spades? no - South can bid spades with four of them|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dJ|mc|10|nt|dburn: no heroics from Schifko, who could have come down to stiff @dK for two down|pg||
nt|georgia19: I thought I'd seen it played denying 4 of other major, but clearly not here, oh well|pg||
nt|dburn: some play that 3@s denies four hearts, certainly|pg||
nt|georgia19: tightened up score, NS will have to dig in to get that qualifying spot|pg||
nt|georgia19: need a good last board....|pg||
nt|dburn: they're probably OK barring calamity on the final deal|pg||
