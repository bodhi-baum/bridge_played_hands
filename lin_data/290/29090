nt|vugraphzbd: Sorry, maybe scores after lunch|pg||
nt|panja: overcalling 1@H on 4 cards ahead of 5 Clubs is a very good idea|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: keeps the bidding low....|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||

nt|panja: 10 tricks in Nt....will it be 11 in @H...could possibly be|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|panja: now....if N leads a @D against 4@H..Declarer can win...discard a @S on @C after finesse..and give up @H...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|panja: that will be 11 tricks...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|panja: and if NS begin by cashing a @S.....Declarer can park one Diamond on @CJ..so 11 tricks in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|panja: no @D ruff...rather unlikely...as there is no entry to S hand after @S discard|pg||

nt|panja: @D ruff. @SA, @D ruff will be one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: Talking here that 6@D was nice|pg||
nt|panja: not making though..except Double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: Both contracts only 13% for NS|pg||
nt|panja: or rather, not even double dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: Jansma told me the scores are at the Bridgmate|pg||
nt|panja: if one desired safety....better idea was to take @H finesse with @CA entry...|pg||
nt|panja: that way, you would not lose against !KX in South hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzbd: Tokay|pg||
mb|4S|mb|4N!|nt|panja: althought..with 6322 shape, that is not all that likely|pg||

nt|ritong: pard just told him " hey i have five cards in @ss"|pg||
nt|panja: difficult decision..with 2 small Hearts..|pg||
