mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 4 heart6s for n/s|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes. As it is, they can make slem, but its an anti percentage slam and they are unlikely to bid it|pg||
mb|2C!|an|NAT, min opening bid, 6+ !cs|mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 10-15, 6+@C|pg||
nt|lady007:  2@c is precision, 10-15 with clubs|pg||
nt|ady: with both red kings  well placed  looks like 12 tricks	 possibly 13 with no club lead|pg||
nt|lady007:  north will probably double now|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lady007:	hmmm|pg||
nt|lady007:  :-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|lady007:  of course south shows 7+ hearts and he has no club honours, but still i would have preferred double with only 2 hearts and quite some defensive values|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Street-Jacobus is the only pair in the USA2 Final that does NOT play a Strong Club system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Jerry: "this will be the dullest board of the match" (joking f course)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: 5 clubs would have been 500   an imp loss to 480 for n/s|pg||
nt|lady007:  i try to avoid bidding 5 over 5 when possible. like here, you make 5@H (even 6) but you get 500 against 5@C. even if 5@c had been 300 its not a disaster when you make 450, but the big gain is when you go down in 5 |pg||
nt|lady007:  and you take 300 against 5@C|pg||
nt|lady007:  better take your safe plus score, especially here, when equal vulnerability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: playing 2/1  Jacobus opened the north hand -- but Jerry Clerkin with safety of limited openers did not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a message there somewher|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Simson in 5@CX|pg||
nt|lady007:  if south really has AKQ 8 times of hearts and a club void he can bid again, as it is impossible that double is clear penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is for Marion   http://www.bridgeace.com/lessons/BOLS/1987_Manfield_Five_Level.pdf|pg||
nt|lady007:  it is 500 now but north cannot be sure of that. |pg||
nt|lady007:  hmm, it seems a bit strange to me that he finesses jack of diamonds|pg||
nt|lady007:  he doesnt need that finesse|pg||
nt|lady007:  if the queen wins, he can take the heart finesse and cross to ace of diamonds to repeat the finesse (or cash ace of hearts, safer if west trickily ducked Kx )|pg||
nt|lady007:  and if the queen loses, you can always decide what to do later|pg||
nt|lady007:  even if it goes ten - king, you cannot be sure you can cross to the AQ of diamonds to take a double finesse in hearts because the 3rd diamond might get ruffed|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ady: hi|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2 suits same color|mb|d|nt|lady007:  we have to remember that all players have been playing for over a week and will be tired by now, which might reflect their play. its always easier when you see all 52 cards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 0-7 hcp|pg||
nt|lady007:  still, it seems that declarer misplayed this hand. he took a finesse he didnt need and then had an awkward guess next round|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: DBL = CRASH|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lady007:  passell would have liked to overcall 1@D the first time|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|ady: 6 spades decent    but fails  either club ruff   or 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF you play CRASH	it is essential that the partnership discusses the adjustment after 1@C-P-1@D-?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lady007:  but i assume they also play Crash in direct postion, so a 1@D bid would have showed 2 suits same rank (majors or minors=|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahollan1: steps can be DBL, 1@H, 1N   or  DBL, 1N, 2@C|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lady007:	if he could have bid 1@D first time, his partner would have jumped to at least 4@D. here we see that you dont get any conventions for free|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and even then  does 1N stay same as after 1@C-1N  or is it purely by number of step|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|lady007:  6@S and 6@C are both fine contracts (6@C probably a bit better) but both have gotten worse after east has showed a red 2 suiter|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lady007:  i probably would, but its a difficult hand. I normally like to overcall 2@C, then 4@S with 5-6 , but you are way too strong to overcall 2@C on this hand. You might argue that it wont get passed out when you have this shape. Thats probably true|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = non-vul|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Vugraphzfb: Dennis asked about 2NT and Passell mouthed something I couldn't understand - sorry|pg||

nt|lady007:  he is taking the safe rout, assuming to lose a heart, a club and possible a spade or diamond, planning to ruff the club loser in dummy|pg||

mb|1H|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 10-15,  this is a recording too|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kit: This is somewhat aggressive at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how many 8-card suits have we seen this week?|pg||
nt|kit: Problem with bidding 4@S is opponents are often forced to double, and they will be right.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kit: Another problem is partner might take you seriously.|pg||
nt|kit: as seen.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: for those who weren't here for the beginning of the set	 http://www.bridgeace.com/lessons/BOLS/1987_Manfield_Five_Level.pdf|pg||
nt|kit: E-W have a slam -- but tough for East to bid it confidently|pg||
nt|lady007:  NS like to bid 5 over 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ed would be wrong on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many may not realize   Ed Manfield's partner was	    Kit Woolsey|pg||
nt|kit: Tough for East to bid the slam, as he knows his partner's pass is likely based on a stiff spade -- which doesn't help the cause any.|pg||
nt|lady007:  dont really see the meaning of 5@S on this hand. You have 1 spade trick and you are red vs white. you need partner to have 9 tricks in his hand for this to be a good save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some asking    over 4@S  does 5@C guarantee @H fit or just natural??|pg||
nt|kit: I think he is bidding as a possible make if he catches the right mesh in partner's hand.|pg||
nt|kit: Clearly 5@C is natural -- what else can you do with a long club suit?|pg||
mb|d|nt|lady007:  yeah agree. fit non jumps normally only apply with a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|lady007:  because then it is ' impossible' that you pass first and then want to introduce a new suit at a high level|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
mc|9|nt|kit: if East doesn't cash ace of clubs, he will continue with 5 of hearts, suit-preference showing club strength.|pg||
nt|kit: I guess declarer just claimed down 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Jerry looked at Wold's hand and said: "2 down"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: very short break|pg||
nt|lady007:  very tight and exciting match so far|pg||
nt|lady007:  lots of action|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Dennis: "what do they make" Jerry: "probably lose a spade and a diamond" Passell: "no, just a spade"|pg||
nt|lady007:  thank you Jan, for your great operating and all the valuable insights of what happens at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  street-jacobus just reached 6@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: It's a pleasure :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wold had to go to the bathroom, now back and says: "I almost bid 6@c, that was the winner"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm sure someone has mentioned this before, but at this event we try very hard to have each table in a separate room with a bathroom, which is good both for security and speed|pg||

nt|lady007:  i thought wold was likely to show clubs+ diamonds here as his clubs are better than this hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wold wrote "color" - Passell wrote "reds or blacks" :)|pg||
nt|lady007:  passel likely to think this shows the black suits|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|lady007:  when he has AKJxxx of hearts :-)|pg||
nt|lady007:  can he bid hearts naturally at some level here? or are all bids pass or correct?|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = highest willing to go opposite black suits|pg||
nt|lady007:  EW can make 5@H here|pg||

nt|lady007:  might east not have 4 spades here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  as said before. no convention is for free|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Wold DBL with @C & @S?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kit: No, why would he?|pg||
nt|lady007:  i dont think he an be forced to double with a weak spade holding (and now he has Txxx of hearts so i assume he can have the same hand with Txxx of spades and Kxxxx of clubs)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Wold: "you have 5 spades ... more?" "no"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just wondering if Passell has extra information to bid on|pg||
nt|lady007:  if EW had played natural here, east might have overcalled 1@D and then west would have showed his heart suit|pg||
nt|kit: Passel thinks his partner has the black suits probably|pg||
nt|lady007:  after which it will be easy for east 'to take the save' |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I think Marion's right here - they needed a way for West to show that he had hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  not that south would have let them play 5@H, with a 5 card suit that he hasnt mentioned before|pg||
nt|lady007:  5crd suit support|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: voice commentary mentioning if Wold had not used any toy  that Passell has natural 1@H over the negative 1@D|pg||
