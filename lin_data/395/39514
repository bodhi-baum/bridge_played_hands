nt|kareno: A useful swing|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|3D!|an|strong Michaels|nt|warrens:  a lot of pairs play 2@D over 1@D as natural and 2@H as michaels, so 3@D is used to show a strong Michaels|pg||

nt|warrens:  good bid by Passell, knowing that 3NT is the likely game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Simson asked Passell about DBL - I think he said "cards" (sort of waved his hand)|pg||
nt|kareno: With the safety play in diamonds this will make on a major suit lead|pg||
nt|kareno: ( you cannot pick up 4-0 diamonds in north so you must start to the king)|pg||
nt|warrens:  a @C lead will make declarer do some work, but he can make it either way|pg||
nt|kareno: Club lead presents problems|pg||
nt|kareno: But north should always be endplayed out of a trick.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: whoa|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Aker made the same 3@D bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: the method raises a theoretical question as to what counts as strong. Here N has appropriate losing trick count, but the potential of the hand depends more on finding a geuine fit ...|pg||

mb|5C|nt|ritong: one of the most butchered bids, imo  people use it to feel like rambo, but do not build much  showing @hs looks quite superior to me|pg||
