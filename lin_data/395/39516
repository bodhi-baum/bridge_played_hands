nt|Vugraphzfb: Wold asks about 2@c - 54 either way in minors or 1435 or 1444|pg||
nt|meargent: @S looks best|pg||
nt|kit: This could be close -- declarer can take 3 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart, 3 spades easily|pg||
nt|ritong: yes	i find " ugly" a bit excessive:)|pg||
nt|kit: but  9 might be tricky, since setting up a club trick means losing 2 club tricks, which might be 5 for defense.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|warrens:  hard to avoid 3NT with 26|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult lead problem -- but heart lead is probably effective here.|pg||
nt|warrens:  since they seem to bid most of them with 24|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will win, cross to ace of clubs, and take diamond finesse I guess.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Passell to Dennis: "good one" D nods|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: well he also has issues with scoring the spades late|pg||
nt|kit: Or he might duck a club when the 10 appears.|pg||
nt|meargent: think @S lead makes def much easier|pg||
nt|meargent: im betting on jerry|pg||
nt|kit: It turns out declarer's best play after losing a diamond finesse may be to play a heart himself, to cut the defensive communications.|pg||

nt|3for3:  This is a little short on 'values' for that action.	Might be Hx of hearts, another possible treatment|pg||
nt|rduran1216:	I'll have to ask for permission, but this is a "classic/obvious" Shan Huang 1nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no, he just changed his mind and has written another explanation for the RD - I think he now said ace of K or hearts|pg||
