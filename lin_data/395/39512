mb|p|mb|p|nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes, not at all obvious to top the diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: BBO actually does save things if the table crashes, but here where the whole internet crashed, the server didn't know our tables had crashed, so there wasn't anything there|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, responding to Al's comment :)|pg||
nt|lady007:  the diamonds finesse and diamonds 22 is 20% chance, while the stiff king on either side is about 12,5%|pg||
nt|meargent: too complicated|pg||
nt|medwards: But the lead was different|pg||
nt|lady007:  at the other table the finesse was even more obvious, because it combined the diamond finesse with hearts 33, so that you can pitch a spade from your hand|pg||

nt|lady007:  someone suggests that not cashing the queen of spades might be an indication that he has the king of diamonds|pg||

nt|lady007:  interesting 2@S opening. Wouldnt have occured to me but of course it can work well. I'm sure Stansby was planning to bid his hearts afterwards|pg||

nt|lady007:  however, he got in trouble now|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|meargent: X probably discussed as showing extra offence|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: ruffing finesse for down 1 and push?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS lead K from AK |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Zwerling wrote something to Stansby, but I can't make it out|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfb: I'm sure you're right, Joey|pg||
nt|lady007:  some pairs might play double as a great minor suit hand as opposed to more penalty orientated. but NS seem to be on the same wavelength here as north passes|pg||

nt|warrens:  guess not :)|pg||
nt|kit: Of course South is now thinking bigger things|pg||
nt|kit: But still not worth it I don't think|pg||
nt|warrens:  maybe 3@H now?  I would pass.  Partner is quite limited.|pg||
nt|kit: And I can't see West barging in with 3@S|pg||
nt|warrens:  he didn't open, so 10 or less, and he didn't cue, so 6-8 or so|pg||
nt|kit: right -- game looks pretty optimistic at best|pg||
nt|warrens:  but 3NT is still a possible bid|pg||
