mb|p|nt|bt:  bidding your longest suit is  a good option|pg||
nt|joest:  now diamond has a good hand|pg||
nt|joest:  he might offer a choice of games here with 4N|pg||
nt|bt:	i agree with you|pg||
nt|joest:  diamond has a good hand here|pg||
nt|joest:  he knows he his facing spade shortness|pg||
nt|joest:  + good enough values to act at the four level|pg||
nt|bt:	4nt is best and 5@D isnt too bad|pg||
nt|joest:  true|pg||
nt|bt:	everything else is kind of silly, IMHO|pg||
nt|joest:  but you would be disappointed to bid 5@d an dfind partner's minors reversed from what they are here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: These players are very quiet and they don't fidget around like some do when consider.|pg||
nt|joest:  I have had three kibds ask me about 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: considering....|pg||
nt|joest:  I think that would probably be 'pick' also since it is unlikely west could have a good one suiter|pg||
nt|joest:  I would also think that it is more slammish and that it shows a spade control|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest:  but this is just me talking|pg||
mb|p|nt|bt:  4@S gets heart into the picture, i think|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:	well then that's a reason not to bid it :)|pg||

nt|joest:  i like 4NT b;c Im almost sure partner will interpret that right in the real world|pg||
nt|bt:	good thinking|pg||
nt|joest:  so this will come down to a guess of the club jack I suspect|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|joest:  so platnick will win this, pull trumps|pg||
nt|joest:  and lead a heart toward his king|pg||
nt|joest:  if the ace is onside and north rises he has the two club pitches he needs|pg||
nt|bt:	declarer might go to dummy and play a low heart ,,,|pg||
nt|joest:  once it is offside he will need to guess the club jack|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|bt:  i agree on your line though|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|joest:  now on this lead he can play for a show upsqueeze|pg||
nt|joest:  depending on how the cards are played|pg||
nt|joest:  but he will be able to ruff a heart low|pg||
nt|joest:  play a club up to the king (hypothetically)|pg||
nt|joest:  then run trumps keeping the spade jack as a threat|pg||
nt|joest:  he might be able to catch Jx offside on this line|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|joest:  so south known to start with KQ of spades + ace of hearts|pg||
nt|joest:  culd he have ace of clubs to get him to 13?|pg||
nt|joest:  maybe|pg||

mb|2C|nt|joest:  a tough bid here for east|pg||
nt|joest:  what would do lars?|pg||
nt|bt:	the inferential 33 in clubs and placing @C in north is the only clue|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  i would double 1@S here|pg||

nt|joest:  i'm not sure what west's best move is right now|pg||

nt|joest:  plus when you are defending against only 1@s time is often not of the essence|pg||

nt|joest:  despite th afact that they have 29 highs|pg||
nt|joest:  in due time I'm sure the operator at the other table will discover his/her error|pg||

nt|joest:  I am trying to remember the last time I saw someone with 19 NOT open 2NT|pg||
nt|joest:  it's been a while :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|joest:  so what to do|pg||
nt|joest:  with east|pg||
nt|joest:  i am sure 1@d is artifical|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d might be|pg||
nt|joest:  or it might be weak|pg||
nt|joest:  often there just is no bid with that east hand in many defensive structures over a strong club|pg||
nt|joest:  of course you could just bid 3@d and see what happens :)|pg||
nt|joest:  hopefully not double all pass!|pg||
nt|joest:  or you could pass and then bid diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Network again.|pg||
nt|joest:  which shows a real hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|joest:	As if it were not already pretty obvious the diamond team is in a lot of trouble here|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:	the Fireman team's client will already have played his 32 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:	and so now the 'front four' of Fireman will play the rest of the way|pg||
pc|dK|nt|joest:  so 3@d was a very effective bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: I've lost the play so I will enter the result after the claim.|pg||
nt|joest:  i have nto played a strong club often enough to know whether it is % to reopen with the north hand|pg||
nt|joest:  in any event the preempt jostled north south into a very poor spot indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: The network comes and goes....|pg||
nt|joest:  and vulnerable to boot|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: After 5 tricks, E/W have 2 and N has 3|pg||
nt|joest:  so as you can see often when you are in trouble in 3@d (as here) they still can't collect|pg||
nt|joest:  east was about to go -300 or so against nothing|pg||
nt|joest:  actually maybe only 100|pg||
nt|joest:  so I'm told hurd and woolridge don't play strong club|pg||
nt|joest:  so that explains a lot|pg||
nt|joest:  like everyhthing|pg||
