mb|4C|mb|p|nt|debrose:	But this time we'll need to come up with a better answer|pg||

nt|debrose:  Yes, for sure|pg||
nt|lc: Even with 5 clubs and 4 hearts and this kind of hand, 2@C is a better start.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lc: With @C 3-2, this will put Gordon in the lead.|pg||

nt|debrose:  6N has play when clubs don't break.  I suppose 6C also has play on a trump coup, or a non spade lead, so I take it back not so clera|pg||

nt|lc: North's @H109x is worth something -- and having honors together and in the long suit (diamonds) is also worth an upgrade.|pg||
nt|lc: In a close match like this, overtricks could be crucial -- the players will likely give them more attention now in the 4th quarter than they would earlier in th ematch.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Howie, still thinking, says "sorry"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sonty: "I wonder if bridge was simpler in the past or we just remember it that way"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: David is up wandering around the room, a sight with which I'm sure you are familiary, Larry :)|pg||
nt|debrose:  lc: Playing for overtricks, note that declarer starts on the suit where he will make at least one extra trick maybe two, and can still safely get another overtrick from the other suit (hearts) later|pg||
nt|lc: Berkowitz at times can't sit still -- right. :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|debrose:  Howie Weinstein is thinking about putting up the club King as second hand, in case his partner has the Ace of clubs and something to set up|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|debrose:  Maybe Kxxx of hearts and the club Ace, since the spades don't work|pg||
nt|lc: Declarer is allowed to know from the tempo that East has the @CK at this point (but West is "not allowed to know.")|pg||

nt|debrose:  As Larry says, some players will often do this.  Some even think it is "expected" But this is controversial, since it's not usually in declarer's interest to make such a statement.  Many overtricks are made at IMPs just because the opponents are|pg||

nt|debrose:  An old fashioned SOUND weak 2, and an old fashioned 3N response to the 2N ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Berk: "does he have a solid suit?" Grabel: "yes, he should"|pg||
pc|c3|nt|debrose:  I teach my students that 3N over 2N shows AKQxxx|pg||
nt|debrose:  However, with many partners I now play it only needs to be AKJTxx, since the AKQxxx hand is so rare|pg||
nt|lc: Agree.  3NT is "Maximum, no feature" -- thus very good hearts.  Could be @HAKJ10xx, too in my opinion.|pg||
nt|lc: This could be a deal, where after the @CQ hold where declarer plays a LOW heart from dummy.|pg||
nt|lc: That protects against 4-1 hearts.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|lc: Declarer wouldn't have 9 top tricks with 4-1 hearts (by ducking a heart) but close.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|debrose:  Yes, if declaer determines he needs only five heart tricks for the contract, that is definitely what he should do.  A classic safety play|pg||
nt|debrose:  Lots of classic lessons on this deal for us bridge teachers|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe he plays a diamond up -- and then ducks a heart later.|pg||
nt|lc: In fact, that's what I like -- a diamond now.|pg||
nt|debrose:  That would seem to risk only North ducking the diamond, not having led one from AJxxx, and then South winning a heart.  Seems like a good plan to me|pg||
nt|lc: Possibly, if he does play a diamond to the king, Berk will duck smoothly (on general principles).|pg||
nt|lc: This illustrates a big difference in form of scoring. At matchpoints, declarer would likely not consider ducking a heart|pg||
nt|debrose:  North is known to have only four clubs from the lead, so I think it's safe to assume that he didn't fail to lead a diamond from AJxxx|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|debrose:  Sontag's @D6 is likely a "Smith Echo" saying that he likes the opening lead in context|pg||
nt|lc: The "smooth duck" of the @DA wouldn't look good if declarer didn't have both the king and queen -- but usually declarers don't lead up to unsupported kings early in the play.|pg||
nt|lc: So, now it is a near certainty that Grabel will duck a round of hearts.|pg||
nt|debrose:  I agree, Larry|pg||
nt|lc: He has 4 top tricks outside of hearts in the bank -- and ducking the heart guarantees the contract (unless 5-0 hearts).|pg||

mb|1C!|an|STR, ART, F1|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|NAT, FG, no 4 card M|mb|p|nt|joest:  so woolsey and stewart did not reach game on theprior board|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest:  they started with a multi 2 and petered out in 3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest:  n-shad two consecutive poor results next door when they could least afford them|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ritong: ouh|pg||
nt|joest:  so this looks pretty naturalish with 2@d being natural and a gf|pg||
nt|ritong: tough decision by sontag|pg||
nt|joest:  Sontry might rebid 3NT but then again Kx of diamonds is a prettybig value with all primes|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|joest:  one of the good things about IMPS in my humble opinion is that you could cue bid 4@c here and not worry about bypassing 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: short break|pg||
nt|joest:  something that would concern you greatly in matchpoints|pg||
nt|ritong: berkowitz will not pass anyway|pg||
nt|joest:  right|pg||
nt|ritong: imho|pg||
nt|joest:  although what we will bid is somewhat harder.  My money is on 4@c but we will find out after their break|pg||
nt|ritong: slam can be totally cold facing stiff @d jack  my guess is he will offer again|pg||
nt|ritong: via 4@c most likely, yes|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea being to localise (does this exist in english?) his features|pg||
nt|joest:  yes it exists |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ritong: pedantic, surely	i m not scared:)|pg||
mb|4H|an|RKCB|mb|p|nt|joest:  btw they did bid 6@d in the other room so if Sontag-Berkowitz canduplicate that this match is almost certainly over|pg||
mb|5D|an|2 + Q|mb|p|nt|joest:  I have had several kibs ask me if 4@c might instead be a suit|pg||
nt|joest:  my answer would be yes it might, although I think that unlikely|pg||
nt|ritong: well he skipped @cs over 2@s|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|joest:  I suspect 4@h was RKCB|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  and 5@d was two with the queen|pg||
nt|ritong: so, even if it is a four cards suit, likely not a playable one|pg||

mc|12|nt|Vugraphzfb: DIscussion about 7 and then Berk says "I almost passed 3N" and some more discussion.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|ahollan1: actually	i think he could find out if Woolsey was short in @H [while showing long @H] but that still doesn't help evaluate the hand potential|pg||

nt|joest:  it is the completleywrong hand for 3@d|pg||

mb|1D|an|Majors or minors|nt|joest:  which is almost certainly the wrong guess :)|pg||
nt|joest:  twosuits of the same rank (I think)|pg||
nt|ritong: you win|pg||
mb|d|an|(5)6-8|nt|joest:  now whether you want to treat 6-4 that way is open to serious question :)|pg||
nt|joest:  so Grabel will bid 2@s or somethign like that|pg||
nt|joest:  he has a big fit in some black suit; he just doesn't know which one|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ritong: you win again|pg||
nt|joest:  2@s = pass or correct|pg||
mb|3H|nt|joest:  Howie's hand is so good I suspect we will see him venture 4@c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joest:  now this is muddying the waters :)|pg||
nt|joest:  this sounds like both majors.  At least it does to me :)|pg||
nt|ritong: well the result other room cancels any (remote) suspense|pg||
nt|joest:  if he has spades with partner he is supposed to alaso have hearts|pg||
nt|joest:  if HOwie thinks he is showing both minors with spade support I think he is dreaming|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|joest:  so berk has a great hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|nt|joest:  and he just did|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  and Howie can get away with leading a top club|pg||
