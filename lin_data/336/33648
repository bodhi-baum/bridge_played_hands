nt|prospero1:  And, yes, hello everyone|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: And system expert John Miller|pg||
nt|kit: May need a diamond shift here -- not obvious at all.|pg||
nt|kit: And if he finds the diamond shift, then North will have to play ace and a spade -- again not obvious.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|kit: Keep in mind, declarer's club suit is concealed.|pg||
nt|kit: so it is difficult to count declarer's tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: oh sorry, it is in dummy|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|prospero1:  I only see eight tops without the diamond shift, so there must be a strip squeeze. Now, though, it's simply cashout|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: oops|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck "Sorry"|pg||
nt|warrens:  that was a tough defense to find, requiring 2 shifts|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p!|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: So, first blood to Diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss asking a question of Meck|pg||
nt|kit: Age-old quesition -- do you run from the frying pan into the fire?|pg||
nt|kit: This time it looks right|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond has been creeping back steadily since the last few boards of the last set|pg||
nt|kit: Although 2@C doubled is going to do okay|pg||
nt|ganz:  would 2h get doubled?|pg||
nt|kit: it won't be sat for if it is|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Looks like only two side suit tricks, so Meckwell will have to take four clubs to beat 2@c|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: which they can't it doesn't seem.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  I don't think Meckwell are in a force here|pg||
nt|kit: South has clear double, but North won't sit it for sure.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|kit: oh wait -- forgot strong club -- then North has to sit |pg||
nt|kit: This hand is quite a trap for N-S|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think Bathurst knows trumps are 4-1, but this is still a complex hand|pg||
nt|kit: 4-1 at best|pg||
nt|kit: oh -- right trump lead|pg||
nt|kit: But I would still think they are 5-0 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: :)|pg||
nt|prospero1:  One pitfall of precision is that forces at low levels sometimes put you in a position where you have to double them in a cold contract or go for a number yourself|pg||
nt|kit: Doesn't seem that complex -- get to dummy, play a club, and start taking tricks.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I play the 6 of @h's from dummy and lead a @s to the J|pg||
nt|kit: yes, that seems right.|pg||
nt|warrens:  the other choice is J of @h's and play a @c from dummy|pg||
nt|kit: Might have to let South score a couple of trump tricks, but can afford that.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|drewsky: I predict that west will emerge with 9 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Well here there are three side-suit tricks, so need to limit trump losers to 2. Not a problem|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: South will pound away on the diamonds, of course.|pg||
nt|kit: not a question of losers -- a question of winners.|pg||
nt|kit: He has only 2 sure side-suit tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: can he come to 6 trump tricks?|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfc: Nice to have Drew Casen, multi-National Champion (and even 3rd once with a lowly Operator)|pg||
nt|kit: But rodwell on the wrong defense -- now declarer may take 4 hearts, 2 spades, 2 clubs.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he'll score 5 @h's, one @c and 2@s's|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|prospero1:  For every club winner Rodwell ruffs, Bathurst can ruff something himself|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kit: same contact and lead in other room -- but there, put up jack of hearts, holding, and led club.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Our superstar Commentator contingent almost as fine as the players here in these two rooms :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: so what happens if defense pays to force declarer, as here?|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He forces back|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|kit: It looks like declarer wins the battle, getting 6 trump tricks.|pg||
nt|ritong: hi barnet|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He has four tricks in, and can take four more trumps by forcing Rodwell|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ganz:	he can play clubs and score all 4 trumps separately...ruff, ck ruffed, dk ruffed, cq ruffed, and now hjt are winners|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, he's got a claim now|pg||

mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfc: Meck "I'm taking a short break"|pg||
nt|drewsky: 31 unanswered IMPS for Diamond team not counting this last result...I dont blame Meck for wanting a break.|pg||
nt|barnets: unusual for meckwell to lose two 470s  on consecutive days|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its just like a NBA timeout when the opponents go on a run...call a time out|pg||
nt|kit: this looks like will be a push, but they can't know that.|pg||
nt|ritong: trying to break the momentum|pg||
nt|barnets: yesterday 470 was apush in oth semifinals|pg||
nt|barnets: both|pg||
nt|drewsky: There is old saying that goes...if they never make a doubled contract against you, you aren't doubling enough|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Not uncommon at this level. Once in LM pairs I was +470 for below average because defense did not pitch overtrick trying desperately to beat me|pg||

nt|robinswr: if you open 1@d, then partner will bid 3@d over 2@h |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "I don't have a problem here, just thinking about the whole hand"|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Weinstein: "I don't think it matters" - shows Hampson his hand|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|an|possibly 4 !hs and clubs|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Other room just went 1NT - 3NT|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h can't be a 5-card since you would have bid 1@h over 1@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Greco asks about1@d and Levin says "didn't you hear what I said?" and then whispers something. Weinstein said it's usually 5 |pg||
