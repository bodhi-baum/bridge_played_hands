nt|prospero1:  Greco will still make 4, because Meck cannot knock out both aces, and one minor loser goes on a spade|pg||

nt|prospero1:  I count 5 spades, four clubs, one dummy ruff, one diamond, so needs two hearts.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Ruffing out the diamonds uses up a high spade in dummy|pg||
nt|prospero1:  The @c10 keeps him from getting five club tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco: "sorry, how's the time here?"|pg||
nt|chip:  Winning line is to draw trumps, take ruffing heart finesse then set up clubs: 6 spade winners, 4 clubs, 2H and a D.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco turned around to check the clock again|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Chip is correct about timing, the ruffing finesse has to come early so he has a late entry to cash the other honor|pg||
nt|chip:  Ruffing out the D works if D are 4-3 and the trumps are 2-2 or stiff J.  |pg||
nt|drewsky: Seems like the best line is to test trumps first and if they are 3-1, then one knows they need the ruffing finesse in hearts.|pg||
nt|MCarroll: k|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Greco "sorry"|pg||
nt|chip:  If Draw trumps initially you have good chances if they are 2-2, when 3-1 looks right to take the ruffing heart finesse, though alternative is to take the club finesse and see if clubs are good for 5 tricks, then when not, as here, you don't have|pg||
nt|chip:  entries to take the ruffing heart finesse and set up/cash the clubs|pg||
nt|drewsky: For sure a complicated hand, since we cant even figure the best line looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|prospero1:  He has to decide now about ruffing diamonds or alternative lines, because he will need the diamond ruff to dummy with the fourth spade as a late entry|pg||

nt|chip:  Levin is playing with a rather annoying cast on his broken hand, which does make produce an extra strain on the players.|pg||

nt|chip:  Of course partner could have a bunch of tricks, but that isn't what the DBL shows (just a good hand) and usually not what partner has so passing works poorly,|pg||

pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - I've lost the play here |pg||
nt|prospero1:  The reason to use the weak NT defense over third seat NT's is that, especially at favorable, experts have a tendency to open 1N on odd hands, such as seven clubs|pg||
nt|chip:  Note that 1N DBL would make at least one here and probably 2.|pg||

nt|prospero1:  It's scary to have a weak balanced hand when the auction starts (1N) - X - (P) ... if you pass, your lack of entries often costs a trick or two on defense, and if you bid, you may easily go for a number|pg||
