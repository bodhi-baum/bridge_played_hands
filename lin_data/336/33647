mb|p|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose:  While it's popular to play something other than 4N as Keycard for minors, most problems can be solved by being careful not to bid Keycard unless one can stand all resonably likely responses|pg||
nt|kriegel:  North already limited her hand with 2NT, so South should probably give up on slam. After 4@C, a raise to 5@C will suffice|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|debrose:  South has a nice type of Keycard hand in theory, but as Oren says, probably needs too many keycards anyway. But even if partner could easily have 3 + the Q, it's necessary to control bid and hope to get partner to bid keycard on such hands|pg||
