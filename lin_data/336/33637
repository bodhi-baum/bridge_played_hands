mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|runnerup:  now ew will reach 3nt ..to make is another thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: opposite lite openings west invites|pg||
nt|germs345: Well west did not make a game force... especially opposite a White red partner seems practical|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|runnerup:	but 3nt as said|pg||
nt|germs345: 2@D is some artificial gazilli-like force|pg||
nt|medwards: The play might take some time|pg||
nt|germs345: North would do very well to stay off normal @d lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: in Gazilli 2@c shows clubs or 16+ art and 2@d shows 8+|pg||
nt|sixela: on this auction, d lead is not normal|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2@h then shows the weak variety|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no real chance but never give up ,,8  is easy'|pg||
nt|germs345: but has been clued in by wests auction so he might not lead a diamond|pg||
nt|germs345: as stated :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: west did not show any suit other than deny heart support|pg||
nt|sixela: he denied spades|pg||
nt|germs345: but tends to deny 4+@S|pg||
nt|sixela: so he is well stocked in the minors|pg||
nt|germs345: @H lead would be killer|pg||
nt|robinswr: If I had four spades and 2 hearts, I would not bid 1@s|pg||
nt|sixela: well, unless you play flannery, that keeps you out of your cold 4s when it is there|pg||
nt|robinswr: I see no clue other than probably heart is wrong|pg||
nt|germs345: Is moss actually thinking?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no real chance but @s lead foe me -partner must have 4|pg||
nt|sixela: everything looks wrong, the question is which leads have the potential to give away the most tricks and tempo|pg||
nt|robinswr: even heart could be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss is "always" thinking :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now sighing|pg||
nt|germs345: so then bathurst has shown a club fit here for sure|pg||
nt|sixela: c and D look worst, h is too big, so that leaves a s|pg||
nt|germs345: @s doesnt look so good either|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Now looking up, resorting hand .........|pg||
nt|sixela: nothing is "good", S looks least dangerous|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  ok ..|pg||
nt|germs345: there we go|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3NT must show club support |pg||
nt|germs345: club lead by south here would now ensure a set|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @c 3 times|pg||
nt|sixela: now trumps are best, but hardly clear from s hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bathurst indicated he promised a @c fit|pg||
nt|germs345: But likely will still go down because the @C10 looks like the 3rd trick |pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup:  yes lets say -1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss "Sorry, thought you would show short @h's"|pg||
nt|germs345: my guess is -2|pg||
nt|sixela: i dont know their sys, but it would seem if you were willing to fore game, you might start with 2d|pg||
nt|germs345: he probably will try to ruff out @D and take a first round spade finesse for multiple entries to dummy|pg||
nt|sixela: must still guess c|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Moss is very deliberate, this hand may take some time . . . |pg||
nt|sixela: hard to do if you rough out d, more likely will try for cross rough|pg||
nt|germs345: that could work|pg||
nt|germs345: he will still try to guess spades early then|pg||
nt|germs345: Nickell did very well to stay of @s lead|pg||
