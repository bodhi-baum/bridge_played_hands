mb|d|nt|BroLucius:  I don't think Sally misplayed that last one, but it could have been made by leading trumps at Trick 2.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  west might bid 4@D now|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North passed at the other table, so it was fairly easy for E/W.|pg||
nt|ady: north did not open in CR     3 passes	 1@H	  then 3@D   by north|pg||
nt|roswolf:  and then a club slam is likely|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  i think the final contract will be 6@C|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Club ruff available against 6@H by East, but that is the only trick.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|roswolf:  maybe not - can west sensibly explore a grand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  West must consider a grand slam now. No, they have stopped safely. Well done.|pg||
nt|roswolf:  no he has just bid what he thought he could make|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Brock decided againsst a Lightner Double because she was uncertain of a seconds trick.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  I don't like the 5@D and 5@H bids at the other table. |pg||
nt|roswolf:  e/w got too high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  North's 5@D particularly wild, but it persuaded East to go too high.|pg||
nt|roswolf:  indeed west was under some pressure in the other room |pg||
mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|ady: seems odd	even with such shape  for the bidding to reach such levels in CR|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  is 3@D intermediate or weak at these colors?|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  South's redouble at the other table suggested the @DK, in which case there was some defensive chance against 4@H (leading a club). In any case 5@D looked potentially expensive.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf:  looks like a swing to proctor|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Yes, but North's 5@D at the other table was lucky to generate this swing. Really East's fault.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|roswolf:  that was wrong doesnt a small club lead to -1?|pg||

pc|d2|pc|s8|nt|BroLucius:  The point about bidding 2NT is that East might have said something at his second turn if he held around 15 points.|pg||

mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Sally Brock and Nicola Smith are currently ranked numbers 2 and 1 in the world women's tables.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf:  will north intervene?|pg||
nt|roswolf:  better to stay quiet on this layout methinks|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  I have not heard of Thornton and Holder, I'm afraid. Can either of  you tell everyone something about them?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  solid county players from the home counties|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  We are all becoming a bit more solid as the years pass.|pg||
nt|roswolf:  :)|pg||
nt|roswolf:  how high will e/w get|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  That is a tradition (old-fashioned) jump shift. West is probably worried that he must do more than raise to 4@H on his good hand.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf:  indeed may lead to slam facing west's controls|pg||
nt|roswolf:  the cannon roars|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|an|2 of 5 + !hQ|nt|ady: 6 hearts can be made     if defeence leads a trump	the spades can be set up   and if  trump not played   then can make ruffing 3 clubs|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Roman Key-card BW and responder shows two keycards plus the trump queen.|pg||

nt|ady: why?|pg||
nt|roswolf:  ah i didnt realise the 9 of hearts enntry would be so important|pg||
nt|ady: Brock may play a trump	  then east must bring in the spades|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  West's use of 4NT suggested a diamond control, so some Souths might have underled the ace of diamonds. In that case declarer might have tried dummy's @DK.|pg||
nt|roswolf:  so the spades could be set up and enjoyed|pg||
