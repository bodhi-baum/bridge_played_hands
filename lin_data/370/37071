nt|athene: but better to save your energy for the cute ending when it's the 9th trick in 3nt, not the 10th :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|athene: will E double 2@D for takeout?|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: i guess you do|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i am not sure of their methods over this 2@C opener but maybe passing denies a really good hand so west doesn't have to do anything enthusiastic|pg||
nt|roswolf:  the winners qualify to play for england in the home international series for seniors -as a team of 4 if procter won they would need to add a third pair -presumably from the team who finished second|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf:  n/s now trying to mix it up a bit -north hardly has a classic weak 2 in @D|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - maybe you do lead trumps a bit|pg||
nt|roswolf:  mind you e/w are in an uncomfortable spot|pg||
nt|athene: you do have six top tricks in the side-suits|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|athene: and no obvious ruffs in dummy|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|d2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|athene: this is not so good because you lose a trick to the @CQ and you don't really set up another winner|pg||
nt|athene: since you have to overtake the ten anyway|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c7|nt|athene: so this is effectively just ducking a club and hoping for a 3-3 break|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf:  6 imps to brock|pg||
nt|athene: it looked more sensible to play a trump because then you are home if trumps are 3-3 and also a lot of the time when south has four (as here)|pg||
nt|athene: ok, a spectator points out that declarer does also gain if the @C9 falls|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  follow the transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had just rebid 2@D north would have been a little too strong to pass|pg||
nt|athene: but with the transfer she can just accept as opener gets another go|pg||

nt|roswolf:  this might generate some action|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  2@S followed by a t/o seems likely|pg||
mb|2C!|an|either !c or 3 card lim raise or better|nt|athene: just counting losers, north might consider going to game - but she only has three trumps which makes a big difference|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf:  2@C=?|pg||
nt|roswolf:  is it a transfer?|pg||
nt|athene: probably includes a limit raise in spades|pg||
nt|athene: "natural GF or 3-card limit raise" is my guess|pg||
nt|roswolf:  ty|pg||
nt|athene: i admit i don't have their system card to hand, though|pg||
nt|roswolf:  this might also get quite murky|pg||
nt|athene: east obviously thinks his double is t/o of spades|pg||
nt|roswolf:  he hopes!?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  north will run|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: ok so when west passes, that shows club strength, so north might get excited about her club void now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but on the other hand the double does increase the chance that spades are not breaking|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so she takes the demure approach|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|athene: 2@C is sort of like drury here - the big advantage is you stop at the 2-level rather than going to 3@s with your limit raise|pg||
nt|roswolf:  e/w are fairly wet in not competing here 3@C was obvious i would have thought|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very wet from west in my opinion|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east should have bid 3@C as well|pg||
nt|roswolf:  true|pg||
nt|athene: of course game-all is the vulnerability that most argues for caution in competing partscores|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Running scores http://www.ebu.co.uk/documents/results-data/live/seniors.htm|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: but still, west can't count diamond ruffs AND natural trump length|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|athene: that is counting the same defensive strength twice over|pg||

mb|d|mb|p!|nt|athene: sorry if EW will be able to run|pg||

mb|2C|nt|roswolf:  conventional wriggle denying a 5 card suiy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C from north, really?|pg||
nt|athene: i was expected pass from north and 2@C from east|pg||
nt|athene: *expecting|pg||
nt|roswolf:  yes all a little odd|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C from north is inexplicable|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: I think Nicola was expecting that too|pg||
nt|roswolf:  if it is right|pg||
nt|roswolf:  south has a difficult bid now 3nt may come into the reckoning|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps NS have the agreement that north only passes the redouble if she has 1NT off in her own hand (in case east passes it and south does not know what to do)|pg||
