pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless a bit of catchup from viewgraph here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but welcome to the semifinal of the gold cup|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the gold cup is the premier KO teams contest in the UK|pg||
nt|panosk:  hello all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and todays teams have already won many matches to get to this stage|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and hi Panos|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|panosk:  Hi Tony, from a very cold Athens |pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Good morning all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: in fact the first round of next years competition has already been played|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and Hi Simon|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Panos, cold is relative|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: N/S here we have Tony Forrester sitting North, I believe, and Peter Crouch sitting south. East is, I think, Alex Hydes, and west Espen Erichsen|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well looks like we are in for a great match|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Both these teams played their quarter finals yesterday|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: Irens beat Green, and Allfrey beat Dunn|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|hA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|CopeyJ: I would imagine E/W play a fairly vanilla style 15-17 5cM base, while N/S play 14-16 5cM, with the usual Forrester methods over 1@C, which I should know by now, but don't really :)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|roswolf:	2nt in the other room looks odd|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  south in the other room opened 1nt and north made an invitational raise with spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf:  thus they failed to find the best fit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  here e/w seem to have lurched into the auction and may not survive|pg||
