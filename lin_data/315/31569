mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  I am told there was an adjustment to the website report that england won|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|pdjourdain:  i mean originally the website reported an England win by 1 but then I am told there was a change to the score|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: not necessarily - it was just that I spoke to Fiona Brown this morning who said that England had lost, but the website reports that they won|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: all rather confusing|pg||

mb|1N|nt|wilkinsona: not sure how this can be done...perhaps 4SX-1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|dburn: certainly the most likely route|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain:  Irens is actually on 144.6 so no tie possible|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: looks like a try for a thin 3NT, this, but the 2@c response is probably not all that it seems|pg||

nt|dburn: down two is enough for Allfrey|pg||
nt|DarrenE:  Irens is 144.6|pg||
nt|dburn: he can play his major-suit ten, but must choose the right major-suit eight if he chooses one|pg||
