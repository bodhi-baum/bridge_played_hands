nt|BridgeGoth: Could be score related, they have to know they are way behind at this point|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yes, and I guess 6@C is a playable contract|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Were behind at the start, then the disaster on 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Actually, it's more than playable, it's making|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Unless E/W have the hand-records on their laps|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: That might actually clue him into the lead.|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Clue who in?  Not sure who's on lead to 6@C, but I think the diamond lead is a hard ask|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  whoever it is|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: If N plays 6@C, Fantoni has to know that @H lead is wrong, and now vs 6@C, @S are surely running, what else makes sense but a @D?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|darek64: maybe 6@c and A@h lead :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  If North does raise to 6@C, I admit it does sound very much like a heart void|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: So of course after i analyze the position, they play it from the other side, thanks guys|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Nevertheless, your comment stands for either West or East, if you trust North's bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The problem is, I'm not sure that with the state-of-the-match, you CAN trust North's bidding|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Yeah, it sure feels like the only place to establish a trick is in @D, but you're right, N/S are swinging|pg||
nt|darek64: small @d is very dificult lead |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I can't quite work out what was going on with that 4@D bid.  There might be more to this auction than we are aware|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Maybe 4@D is forward going bid for the minor?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bjacobs:  Hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  This is either a psychic cue or a total misunderstanding|pg||

pc|hA|pc|d3|pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Frankly, the 4@D bid never made any sense.  The way to go forward in partner's minor was to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Well this shows even the best in the world make mistakes|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: As Bill said, you'd be hard pressed to find a stronger table than this anywhere in the world|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I'm going to guess that South thought North's 3@H was asking for a stopper|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: That is quite possible, maybe S was expecting 4@C to show this hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  That makes HIS bidding totally logical|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Right, I reckon they play Leaping Michaels, but North didn't want to make a non-forcing 4@C bid|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Then again with those minor suit holdings, does 3@H asking really sound possible?|pg||

nt|pelu:  @S to A, @dK and only 3 tricks for Nunes|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: Well, i would not have opened the west hand, but thats just me|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It was unfortunate that the double came from South.  If the double had been from North, they would have got out to 2@H|pg||

pc|h7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|BridgeGoth: also a bit unlucky, if Fantoni's majors were reversed, he'd have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Anyway, South is going to come under some pressure here|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: with 4333 he can gamble, but 3433 is a problem for them|pg||

pc|s8|pc|h9|nt|pelu:  why didnt S play @dK in trick 2?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  A club pitch will, I think, get them their 1100|pg||
