nt|jkdood: On some days, a "flat" West might prosper in 3N. Here clubs are a bother for NT, but at least the entries are with the short clubs|pg||

nt|jkdood: WD to NS to stop and make, seems to be a plus result, no worse than a tie or maybe -1 imp if +170 comes in on the guess of the trump J|pg||

nt|jkdood: The top experts and literature recommend a trump lead versus 7 of a suit, and this hand is a perfect example of when that helps|pg||
