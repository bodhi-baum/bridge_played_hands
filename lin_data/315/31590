nt|patricck: The semi-finals were both very close.....one was won by 8 IMPS and the other, after a ruling early in the match was a margin of 0.4 IMPs|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|panosk:  *easily, my typing not much better Patrick |pg||
nt|patricck: I guess how tempting the pass is depends on how light partner might be for the takeout double....for instance if partner was 4 points and 0445 you would not want to be defending ...|pg||
nt|patricck: 2@S doubled|pg||
nt|panosk:  very true|pg||

mb|p|nt|panosk:  and Q@S , sorry|pg||
nt|patricck: even if partner had xxof spades there would be compensating values elsewhere andmaybe a doublew finesse in spades|pg||

nt|roswolf:  brian tries to make it crystal clear|pg||
nt|ady: except	sorry	 4th club not good|pg||
nt|pdjourdain:	Danger though as Penfold must not assume South has the jack|pg||
