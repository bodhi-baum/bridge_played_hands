nt|vugrapha2: Crompton just stated that she was tired with a laugh as she played the diamond. Apparently it was a bit of a guess|pg||
nt|jkdood: Well, as specs note, a diamond was ruffed earlier, there was NO guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Can even make 6@D in the 3-3 fit!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Very light opening bid 2nd seat vul....|pg||
nt|jkdood: North transfers to spades, 2@S shows 4 and a minimum|pg||
nt|jkdood: ON a good day, 6@S makes; today it looks too tough for 12 tricks|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Other room Board 1 stopped in 3@S (not 4) but also down 1. PUSH.|pg||
nt|jkdood: 4@H also makes NS|pg||
nt|jkdood: The @S ruff if found, is with a natural trump trick, so no real damage|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: although it seemsl like crompton is seriously considering 6 of something here|pg||
nt|jkdood: Or going back to spades, not sure what 4@H means|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: North makes an admirable disciplined sign-off|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: (That was more likely)|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Crompton went 4 stating "i don't know what 4 hearts means". Apparently a little upset|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: First upset i've come accross today|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugrapha2: still a little whinging occuring|pg||
nt|jkdood: These are long grueling efforts for 4 person teams. Commonly teams in Big events are 6 players with sitouts|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but the peace is just kept by some self-denigration on the part of micheal|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|jkdood: A @C lead might test declarer, a heart lead not really|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jkdood: EVen if club led and Q of @C not played, West gets in and leads another; East's 9 (of @C) is a big card then|pg||

mb|p|nt|jkdood: But an imp is an imp|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jkdood: Especially in a match this close|pg||
nt|jkdood: So 2 pushes to start, not what the Crompton team needs|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jkdood: On a decent day NS 6@S but bad break today|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: Some game try for N now?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|jkdood: EVen with his partner opening light and a singleton in the @D suit opened, its a nice hand. Not sure 4@S is right though.|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5N|nt|jkdood: THis will go down more than one most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha2: ah well, i thought they might have landed a sneaky 5 spades but alas|pg||
mb|6C|nt|jkdood: The other room stopped in game, so the lead will widen|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: Best shot is lead @S 9 and get a cover :)|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Perhaps 3 or 4, lucky to be Not vul and just -50 per under-trick|pg||
nt|jkdood: Otherwise, 11 more imps to Neill|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h8|nt|jkdood: Well true the double hook in fact guarantees 6 woulkd make. Too bad for 7 now|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|jkdood: Unfortunately for Crompton, a double minus|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jkdood: 50 imps down with 9 boards to go will need lotsa swing|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Crompton did pick up 2 imps however (made 5 in other room  although in 2@S as well)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 6@H here NS was an opportunity|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jkdood: The @C is a Big Club, so 2@D is an artitificial call for West|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry to bother you jk but what did the open room make on that hand that went down 4 doubled?|pg||
nt|jkdood: 1s -50|pg||
nt|jkdood: So here (in 3N) the @S Q was dropping, but the lead induced play of the J, losing a trick technically speaking|pg||
nt|jkdood: If declarer takes an inspired view of @ds, he should still score up his game, but lotsa work to do|pg||
nt|jkdood: He may try a @C towards dummy for a helpful entry; will not work|pg||
nt|jkdood: And he needs to dislodge that @H Ace with South before it can be used as an entry to cash long spades. Tough hand.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Granted, tough to make, but seems possible|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jkdood: Other room in 4@H as well, making on the nose. Of course, when you are IN 6, u play it differently|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|jkdood: And he tried just what we said, and will be down almost for sure now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jkdood: Not at all easy|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jkdood: A club lead could also create an entry problem|pg||
nt|jkdood: So all in all, Good Stop in 4 :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jkdood: The unfortunate (unlucky?)  spade play at trick 1 made all the difference|pg||
nt|jkdood: He will be down, but on the run of the spades, N may fall under some pressure in the red suits, to minimize the set|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|jkdood: A@H now then @D ten|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|jkdood: So down 1 -50 will be the result|pg||
nt|jkdood: And a push board, as other room just did that as well|pg||

pc|hK|pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jkdood: Even a low @d ruffed high then return to dummy with a heart would have meant the overtrick at least|pg||

nt|jkdood: Nico, take your shirt off or something :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: Last hand of the day and Crompton only needs 78 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jkdood: Now last board, Thanks specs for your attention and patience, NICO for your help, BBO, and NSW organization. Congrats to NEILL team.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkdood: 4@S/5@C EW here, NS have the reds!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: EW can make game in @H or @S|pg||
nt|jkdood: Probably bring home 3NT as well|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 1@H showed spades, like a transfer|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|jkdood: Intended mainly to make stronger hand the declarer and get opening lead "into strength"....|pg||
nt|jkdood: Here, if EW plays in 4@h its has the ironic unintended effect of the opposite|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: ON most days, stronger hand has AQ or Kjx or such and its helpful if it is not "led thru" right away|pg||
nt|jkdood: On the current hand, no such "tenaces" exist, so doesnt really matter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|jkdood: Its awkward to guess spades and also enjoy a pitch, so making 4 or 5 as per how the @S queen is guessed or not, is most likely|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|jkdood: Saves at Both-Not-Vul are rarely fruitful; Here NS might have made some reward from it|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: ever considered writing for the newspaper?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jkdood: They played spades in other room, and the bad break sunk it. Here 4@H is cold.|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: In style i've managed to lose the play on the last hand|pg||
nt|jkdood: Neill will therefore finish with an 80+ victory and and a last hand pickup|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: but if jk is right and the hand is cold then it doesn't matter too much|pg||
mc|12|nt|jkdood: This is likely +420 to EW  450 if guess the spade Nico|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Thanks everyone! A lot of fun. Special thanks to jk and his special take on things|pg||
nt|jkdood: OK FOlks thanks again come back soon!|pg||
