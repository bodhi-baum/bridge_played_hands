mb|p|mb|6H|nt|meargent: they do for most part in us the problem is the 3rd pair ie the sponsers pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Well they may reach 6@H but with 4-1 break (yes i SAW it) looks too tuff|pg||
mb|p|nt|Psyck: 6@h would have had a hope if played by East, none when played by W on @d lead|pg||

nt|meargent: on team the US has at least 8 1st class pairs but almost no team has 3 of them|pg||
nt|meargent: indeed|pg||

nt|jkdood: Some think without a @D lead 6@H could make despite the 4-1 break. But wouldnt be easy.|pg||
