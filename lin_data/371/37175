mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|patr1cks:  normal for NS here to bid a major before diamonds, so the suit doesn't get missed if partner has a weak NT|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|patr1cks:  reverse here by IS, forcing one round|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|patr1cks:  most people play 3L bids over a reverse as GF these days (2N as puppet to 3@C on ewak hands is common)|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  descriptive bid by North, but it does tend to highlight his spade weakness|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  so expect a spade lead;  @S9 would be magic (but not enough to defeat 3N)|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: Matheson studying his hand and the bidding .... |pg||
mb|p|nt|patr1cks:  he too knows his partner is short in spades and he has good diamond support|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|patr1cks:  have been a few slam hands already, is he sniffing for another?|pg||
mb|4H|an| |mb|p|nt|patr1cks:  generally expecting 4@H from this pair as ace asking over diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: How should you play the @d suit? |pg||
mb|4S|an| |mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patr1cks:  but this response doesn't fit that (or has he shown 3 aces?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: 3@d was GF|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  a lot of work to do here, particularly with heart finesse wrong, and trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: Sime explaining - i think 4@h was keycard, and South showed 2 without Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: His screen mate is Jourdain, and he (of course) knows about the Q|pg||
pc|h4|nt|patr1cks:  declarer needs clubs working for him here, so that'll be his first task - setting them up|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  unfortunate lead here, thinking that he only needs @HQ with partner to set up some tricks before he gets in with @DQ|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  suggests more faith in the oppo bidding than it seems to deserve|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: This might take a while.  Sime has his arms folded, and staring intently at dummy|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  the clubs are strong enough that he could play either hand for the queen, and diamonds could be played|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: 6@d minus 2 in other room|pg||
nt|patr1cks:  either way, so hard to know which way Iain wil jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzen: But by South rather than N |pg||
