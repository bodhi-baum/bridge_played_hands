nt|roswolf:  agree|pg||
nt|athene: he might well not be able to find anything over 3@S|pg||

pc|cK|nt|roswolf:  wow that was very wet|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: well, it is a weak NT strength opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: weak-2 in the other room certainly accelerated things|pg||

nt|athene: flat 13 facing passed hand..|pg||
nt|roswolf:  i play 2@D as F 1 round even after an initial pass|pg||
