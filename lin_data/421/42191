pc|d2|nt|nilsland:  No problem with this hand, exactly 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: hagen normally bids 3@h, knowing nine trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I should have mentioned earlier that we have to close down after each round to load the deal for the next round|pg||
nt|ritong: must be some smoker, joe:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: They have said there is no real problem, but a very loud alarm goes off every 10 seconds or so|pg||
nt|ritong: duh|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: seems to have stopped now|pg||
nt|ritong: so west has to tackle trumps knowing south has reopened|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||

nt|ritong: would you overcall 2@s over 1@s?|pg||
nt|ritong: rather close|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: announcement that alarm was not a problem -- "Sorry for any inconveniences"|pg||
nt|nilsland:  maybe better to wait until second round?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: repeating announcement over again |pg||
nt|ritong: @ss are meager|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: no 2S for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|ritong: 3@h is a typical bid of this form of scoring, imo|pg||
nt|ritong: since it allows to stop low  with another formula, hiding @ds would be dabgerous|pg||
nt|odysseus69: want to have intermediate spades -10s and 9s -plus singleton heart suggests maybe rough ride for oppo|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Gabsi_Prob: 2@H, 1@S can be forcing one round?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c3|nt|nilsland:  bidding 2@D would probably end the bidding - N thinks this is better, but when @H are 5-1 it isnt|pg||
nt|ritong: of course 1@s is F1:)|pg||
