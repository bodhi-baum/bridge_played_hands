nt|bjacobs:  what did he need to do?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  OK, ruff a spade high ... still, that line comes with risks of its own|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  Play @h after dumping a @h.....ealrier in the game, defenses know less...maybe more difficult to find the trump shift...maybe|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  No he could certainly make it by ruffing a spade high, then ruff the last diamond|pg||
nt|TarekR:  Of course but if N pitches he can discar K@h either way it is a loser on aloser type situation I believe|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Then a trump ... in fact, ruffing a spade high didn't have much risk at all|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  but as long as S takes his time to think, he will always play back a trump, to minimize dummy number of tricks|pg||

pc|sK|mc|11|nt|kareno:  Oh, discussing Gowdy's theory were you?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  yes, you guessed it. |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  you can reverse engineer the start of the conversation :)|pg||
nt|kareno:  Well that was a costly spade pitch|pg||
nt|kareno:  :)|pg||
nt|TarekR:  Folks we shall see you again in how many minutes Sharon?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: They are on the last board in the closed room, and after a short break we will be back for the last quarter|pg||
nt|TarekR:  THX|pg||
nt|kareno:  Thanks to our excellent operator, the commentators, and of course the specs :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: This is the last board of this quarter. I expect we will start again about 10 minutes after the slower table finishes|pg||

nt|pef: so this match is going to be decided in the final quarter|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: This is really the third quarter of the match - the idiot who started the broadcast (me) somehow managed to type 4 of 4 instead of 3 of 4. I've been told to try 4 of 3 next set :)|pg||
nt|pef: to be fair to the idiot, it's always amazing Jan Martel can keep track of this many matches in this many events--the community owes her an enormous debt|pg||

nt|pef: so with a big third quarter by meltzer this match is going to be tied or at most 1 imp difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Smith: "do you play Smith?" "yes" "regular Smith?" "yes"|pg||
