pc|h5|nt|Chick: Hi Phil... any idea what 3@D means in this auction?|pg||
nt|phil: every card is placed nicely, so there isn't much work to do|pg||
nt|phil: I don't Cornelia, sorry|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|phil: maybe a version of transfer lebensohl / rubensohl|pg||
nt|Chick: a knowledgeable kib tells me it's transfer Lebensohl, invitational or better in spades|pg||
nt|phil: in the versions Ive seen, 3@h shows that, but like many treatments there are many variations, so remember that the next time you sit down with a new partner and say something like, ...|pg||
nt|phil: "XYZ OK??"|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|Chick: How many of us learned our conventions (or part of each new convention) at the table when partner said, "xxxx ok?"  :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|phil: a heart back gives this contract problems|pg||
nt|phil: declarer can score 4@d 2@h and 2@c but thats it|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil: I think declarer was expecting every high card to be on his right (sans the @hK)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Chick: E will just play the opening bidder to have the @SA, both because of the opening, and because he needs it there|pg||
pc|h8|nt|phil: and might have even though he had an 'avoidance' position in clubs....|pg||
nt|Chick: note the @H8, suit preference for spades|pg||
nt|phil: but its hard to see how you can make this contract without the spade suit...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|phil: was winning the @hj a posioned gift? If he overtakes and plays a spade, I dont think this goes down|pg||
nt|Chick: he can't even get all the minor suit tricks because he has no entry for 2 finesses|pg||
nt|phil: unless he develops some in spade you mean? |pg||

nt|phil: but 2@d with a balanced hand isn't that wise either - it will work against your run of the mill at a regional, but not here|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|phil: 4@h? |pg||

mb|1S|nt|Chick: too good for 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil: I'm predicting the play here will go rather slowly....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Chick: bye bye club loser, he might actually make this now|pg||
nt|phil: good start for declarer - Fred can take an early club pitch, but dummy is at risk of getting tapped - maybe he can hold his losers to three trump tricks|pg||
nt|phil: so the intuitive start is @dA, @hK, @dK, ruff a minor and start playing hearts....|pg||
nt|phil: with the doubleton heart on his right and trump length, he has a fighting chance|pg||
nt|Chick: I don't really see a good reason for leading the @DQ.  |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|phil: me neither - this auction yells - take our tricks!|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Chick: not to mention that leading Q from QJxx (even QJ9x) is about the fifth-worst lead in bridge :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|phil: I think the defense's small trump will get washed up |pg||
pc|c7|pc|h8|pg||
nt|phil: he might even make 5 :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|phil: especially if Pratap starts ruffing in now|pg||
nt|Chick: best is probably to throw a @D so he can overruff later|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: the ace of spades is a penalty card. Gordon didnt see his heart|pg||
nt|phil: I think Fred just follows his discards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: the director is at the table|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|phil: oops|pg||
nt|phil: but the play was going down that path anyway|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: so instead of playing the heart, he was holding the ace of spades|pg||
nt|Chick: so he had to play the @SA, but funny thing is, play would be the same anyway|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Chick: one factor here is that the forced @SA didn't give away the fact that it was singleton|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|s5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|phil: so back to 4 - I wonder why Fred didnt ruff the club in dummy...|pg||
