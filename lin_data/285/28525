nt|cherilou: amazing to bid 3NT and take zero tricks!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: yep -- down 9 in a voluntarily bid 3NT you don't see often.|pg||
nt|cherilou: Seems like W can never find out that partner has @D AKQ--w/out knowing that would not want to be in grand|pg||
nt|kit: this is a puppet Stayman auction I believe, but I don't know what their followups are.|pg||
nt|kit: It is hard to imagine that West will bid a grand -- he is off two top clubs and 3 top diamonds, and he can't expect his partner to hold all of these|pg||
nt|kit: So he may just settle for 6NT|pg||
nt|cherilou: E has a perfect hand for W yet still on finesse|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kit: I'm told it has the normal Puppet meaning -- 4 hearts, fewer than 4 spades, inv+|pg||

mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kit: But I have no idea what Fleisher is trying to accomplish with his sequence|pg||

nt|kit: 5NT is pick a slam -- that we know|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: 2@h shows 4 hts invitational plus. 3 diamonds natural. 5NT pick a slam|pg||
nt|kit: So they got to a much inferior slam -- if the diamonds were 4-1, they could be losing 14 IMPs instead of 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|cherilou: he must have shown @D's otherwise 6@D is strange|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but why would Fleisher want to play in diamonds anyway, with the diamond concentration all in the short hand?|pg||
nt|cherilou: I agree|pg||
nt|kit: Now if Fleisher had gone directly to 5NT without showing the diamond suit, then Kamil would bid 6@D only with a 4-bagger -- that would be another story.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: I've never understood the attraction of opening 1NT with a 5-4-2-2 hand and a 5-card major -- it isn't like there are rebid problems|pg||
nt|kit: They will have to find the queen of clubs -- and since they won't know about the 7-2 diamond split they may get it wrong|pg||
nt|cherilou: I am in complete aggreement--it's a puzzle|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, they will certainly get to 6@H|pg||
nt|cherilou: either N or S might lead a @C|pg||
nt|cherilou: assume N will be on lead after transfer|pg||
nt|kit: It will be played from the West side I would think, after East starts with a transfer|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|kit: And even if played from East side, South won't lead a singleton club since he holds a side ace|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kit: And I don't see why North would lead away from a queen either -- looks like safety is more important, particularly if opponents have keycard auction and stop off a keycard.|pg||

nt|kit: Sorry, North|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: If he does so, that is a slight argument for playing North for the queen of clubs, since if North had nothing in clubs he might have chosen a club lead instead.|pg||

pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: serious/non-serious	 the idea is that when 3N is NOT a possible contract  you can differentiate cuebids that are serious slam tries vs cuebids that are just convenient noises|pg||

nt|barnets: maybe he would finesse like Lall did|pg||
