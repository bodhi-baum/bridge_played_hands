nt|athene: hi good afternoon Hedy, hi everyone|pg||
nt|leziya: wlc|pg||
nt|HedyG: hey Bill :) welcome|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding here does seem a bit strange - hard to say who overbid without knowing a bit more about their methods|pg||
nt|athene: normally if 2NT = limit+ in spades, then you would expect 3@S to be a sign-off|pg||
nt|athene: in which case helgemo hasn't really got a 4@S bid - he has 8 losers|pg||
nt|athene: on the other hand both north and south have 'almost' got extras :)|pg||
nt|HedyG: NS CC: http://info.ecatsbridge.com/Systems%5C2012worldchampionships-lille%5Copenteams%5Cmonaco/helgemo-helness.pdf|pg||
nt|athene: and you don't mind so much being in 4@S on these cards - sometimes the defence won't get their club in the bag before you get the diamonds going|pg||
nt|HedyG: waiting for new opps|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: now Tony Forrester & Andrew Robson|pg||
nt|HedyG: ty Murat|pg||
nt|HedyG: 2NT was gf with 4 card fit / CC|pg||
nt|HedyG: 3@S not minimum|pg||
nt|athene: ok ;)|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north argued that he would open a 5332 hand with those honour cards, so his sixth spade is extra|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|athene: normally if people pass like that it's because they are intending to go for penalties|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. pass a re-opening double|pg||
nt|HedyG: 3NT looked right with the W hand IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but with a heart fit and not-incredible clubs, it looks odd|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|HedyG: 2@c was only -1 so really not worth a penalty X|pg||
nt|athene: yes, it's a big view to go for penalties at a low level when you have a fit for partner|pg||
pc|cA|nt|HedyG: but i would not not bid 4@H, i much prefer 3NT with 13 hcps outside @h|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||

nt|ritong: 4/6|pg||
nt|HedyG: all the more reason for 3NT|pg||
nt|leziya: 1. ile 2.nin karþýlaþmasý|pg||
nt|athene: it might look aggressive since his partner has not promised anything, but i think he might have been relying on the auction to tell robson he didn't have  massive hcp strength|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe they have the agreement they would double 2nt with lots of hcp, so 3@C is just showing the pure offensive handtype|pg||

nt|HedyG: he can ruff the @H and still finesse|pg||
nt|athene: sure, but then you can't pick up Kxx onside|pg||
nt|HedyG: no|pg||
nt|athene: would helgemo double just on the strength of an ace and a third-seat 1@C from partner? maybe forrester already decided the spade is off|pg||

nt|athene: i was wondering if forrester would bid just 2@S|pg||
nt|HedyG: lol|pg||
nt|athene: on the basis that robson made a free bid of 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: so if you double + bid (normally showing 18+ or the equivalent), when partner has done that, you should be forced to game|pg||
nt|HedyG: waiting for new opps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe forrester did not want to risk some silly misunderstanding if he noodled around exploring 6@D/6@S|pg||
nt|athene: i remember it was quite amusing back in the 1990s when they played together, because whenever they both entered some bidding panel on a magazine, they would give different answers ...|pg||
