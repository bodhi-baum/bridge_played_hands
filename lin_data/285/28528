nt|prospero1:  Good afternoon, everyone ... looks like we're down to two matches|pg||
mb|d!|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Platnick's opening is a precision special ... too big a range for 1@h if you're playing standard|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|prospero1:  Diamond had a rare decision ... when you double 2N, the opponents usually bid your singleton suit, not your four-card one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|prospero1:  Certainly with Platnick's sixth heart they're better off in 4@h|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Platnick is going to have to guess hearts, or ruff two clubs|pg||
nt|prospero1:  With the 2N overcall, I think I would plan to ruff one club and hook Wolpert for the @hQ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Of course, that is easy when I'm looking at all four hands|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|prospero1:  Another spade here is uncomfortable, because he will have to cash the third one before finishing trumps|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Works from Wolpert's side as well, but seems unnatural to lead into the tenace|pg||
nt|prospero1:  But it's likely to work anyway if Kranyak is 55|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h8|nt|prospero1:  Moment of truth, but Platnick has inference that if Kranyak had another heart, he could have gotten a spade ruff|pg||

nt|BobThomson:	1@s was apparently natural, but psychic|pg||
mb|p!|nt|BobThomson:  As North now, I would be tempted to bid 4@s just for the symmetry|pg||
mb|p|mb|d!|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfk: Many argue that bidding anything over 1@c is worth throwing the cog into the system, at these colors, certainly looks to have been effective|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	Yes, you can't let these expert big club players bid their hands to the best contract unmolested|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Had E not overcalled, NS would have easily diagnosed their fit|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	3@s would have gone down more than game, but less than slam|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	South has a good hand.	What did it mean that North passed and then bid 3NT instead of bidding 3NT directly?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Bathurst must suspect something, however, holding xxxx in spades either his partner is very short... or|pg||

nt|prospero1:  sorry ... 1@c, then that is the way to do it|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Harder to get doubled in a seven card fit when you get 33 or 42 splits|pg||
nt|3for3: slam has play here.  |pg||
nt|prospero1:  Precision pair has a harder time reading what's going on ... the 3@s bump is what killed them|pg||
nt|3for3: not sure you can handle all of the poorish splits|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Well, you have eight tricks on top, so you need four more|pg||
nt|3for3: 2 long hearts|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Might be able to pull it off if spades were 22|pg||
nt|3for3: i guess you can do it...|pg||
nt|3for3: might require club lead to knock out an entry|pg||
nt|prospero1:  If he ducks the club lead, and they don't shift to trump, that would do it|pg||
nt|prospero1:  trump shift pretty obvious, though|pg||
