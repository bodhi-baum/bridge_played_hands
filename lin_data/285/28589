pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d3|pc|hK|nt|dank: John's play of the @HJ at trick 1 is suit preference for the higher side suit (diamonds), so that if Gavin had a quick entry he would know how to cross for his heart ruff|pg||

nt|prospero1:  @dQ lead is Rusinow ... lower of touching honors|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Meckwell lead Rusinow against suit contracts when they have shown length in the led suit|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Diamond lead has the effect of cutting Rodwell's communication to Meckstroth's hand|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2D|an|good heart raise|mb|2H|nt|dank: a featherweight opening here by Gavin|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dank: both pairs on the Kranyak team are playing the same system, which is a strong club system known as "mini-Meckwell" because Rodwell invented it|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dank: it allows them to open extremely light hands, as you can see, which often puts a lot of pressure on the opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: and often they escape when they are in trouble, as here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dank: I stand corrected -- I am informed Gavin and John are playing 2/1, not a strong club|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dank: If Nickell had passed his partner's double of 3@H he could have collected +500 -- instead he will have to settle for +130 in 4@D|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|d7|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d|nt|prospero1:  Meckwell don't worry much about length in the other major when they open weak 2's|pg||
mb|2N|an|!C suit or lead|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  After the takeout double, Meckwell play transfers starting with 2N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Here he plans to go back to 3@h, but wants to indicate a club lead|pg||
pc|c6|nt|medwards: Form of Mccabe|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So how likely is Dwyer to guess the @sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|prospero1:  The advantage of playing transfers over the double is that in the rare case that you want to play 3@c, you can do that too by passing the transfer|pg||

nt|prospero1:  At least for shape ... still not clear if he has what he needs to locate the @sQ|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Pointed out in the voice commentary that Dwyer was farsighted to cash diamonds so Rodwell couldn't discard diamonds on club winners|pg||

mb|3H|nt|prospero1:  slam here requires picking up the diamonds|pg||

mb|4H|an|Art, max for !S|nt|prospero1:	The only time you don't want to duck is with @dAJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  4@h is a "loud noise" for spades|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Now Roman Key Card Blackwood|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  5@c shows 0 or 3 key cards, 5@d asks for the @sQ|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  5@h probably shows the @sQ and the @hK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Probably 5@c over 4@d would have been a strong diamond raise|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|prospero1:  So, we'll get to see how well Bathurst can guess the diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Notice no Rusinow lead here because Meckstroth did not bid hearts|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Meckstroth, of course, is well capable of ducking the @dA twice|pg||
nt|prospero1:  This will be early karma for the whole day ... if Bathurst gets this right, it will be a long day|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Looks like it was made at the other table|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|an|relay to 2!S|nt|dank: Gavin's 2@H is a "puppet" to 2@S -- usually showing a weaker 2@S bid|pg||
nt|dank: this is part of the BART convention|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|dank: Kranyak of course is too strong to accept the relay with his actual hand and jumped to 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sixela: if kranyak bid 2s, NS should findtheir d fit, if he bids 3, my guess is that ends theauction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Kranyak:  "I guess he is pretty weak"|pg||
nt|dank: if Gavin had bid 2@S directly over 2@C (instead of 2@H) it would have shown about 8-11 High card points and usually exactly 2 spades|pg||
nt|sixela: this couldgo down on a club lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dank: should go down on any lead i think |pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|sT|pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|prospero1:  Sometimes your defensive methods against 1@c don't exactly fit what you have|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Dwyer could have bid 1N for the minors, but is 54 and would lose the heart suit|pg||
nt|prospero1:  On this hand it would have worked well with the diamond fit and no heart fit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Alternatively, Dwyer might have pre-balanced with a double of 2@s, because at that point both Meckstroth and Rodwell were limited|pg||
nt|prospero1:  However, he didn't know Rodwell was coming down with three trumps|pg||
nt|prospero1:  If he had a singleton, the hand was likely a bad misfit and it's best to take your best shot at defending undoubled|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dank: gavin and john might be about to get lucky here. slam is a very poor contract but the hand is friendly enough that they will make it if they get there|pg||

nt|sixela: if they get there, they will make it on a d lead, no choice of play|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfj: My guess is he was probably hoping Kx with West|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Yes, I agree|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|nt|dank: Nickell appears to have mis-responded to his partner's 2@C opener. let's see if they can recover|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dank: that solves that. Nickell bid 6@H at the end and that should be made. If Gavin leads a diamond there is some chance Katz goes down|pg||
nt|dank: if Katz is worried that diamonds are 6-1 he may try to return to hand with a spade ruff, which will not work with hearts 5-1 on this layout|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: short break ---	Nickell "I pulled the wrong card so the rest of the auction is sort of made up"|pg||
nt|dank: it was in fact a 13 IMP pickup, as N/S at the other table did not find 6@H|pg||
nt|dank: hands 65 and 69 nicely illustrate the luck factor in bridge: if hearts had not been 3-3 on board 65, that would be 10 or 11 imps the other way|pg||
nt|dank: and if the club finesse had lost here, slam would likely have gone down (yes, if the major suits are very friendly 6@H might make anyway)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: break|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|prospero1:	Second 11 count I've seen Meckwell decline to open|pg||
mb|p|nt|prospero1:  2@d 10-15, "4415 without a card"|pg||
nt|prospero1:  could be 43 in majors|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Rodwell can't be sure that Meckstroth has four spades, and he sees @dKQT opposite the singleton|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|prospero1:  A little poker on the opening diamond lead ... is Rodwell confident of his stopper? If so, maybe diamond lead isn't best|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|prospero1:  So the spots tell Rodwell there are five diamonds to his left|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Bathurst should infer Rodwell has @cK because he crossed in clubs, not hearts|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Katz shifted to the @hK at trick 2 to beat 2@s on 73, so five more IMPs to Nickell|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dank: Gavin's slightly aggressive decision to force to game with the East hand may get E/W into trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|dank: although if 4@H is a picture bid (denying a side suit control) then Kranyak knows they are off two aces|pg||
nt|dank: and if it's fast arrival it is also unlikely that Gavin has a hand where slam has any play|pg||
nt|dank: in the other room, Meckwell had a very long auction to stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Nickell asks if last hand was down 2.  Wolpert:	"yes, if there were another finesse, I would have lost it"|pg||

nt|prospero1:  Bathurst may have not expected Rodwell to have an 11 count|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|prospero1:  1@c strong. artificial, 16+ unbalanced, 17+ balanced|pg||

nt|prospero1:  2@c 5+ hearts|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|prospero1:  2@s shows three card heart support and extras|pg||
nt|prospero1:  "extras" is somewhat loosely defined|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  3@c is natural here ... I'm not sure of their agreements to decide which trump suit is primary|pg||
nt|prospero1:  3@h probably emphasizes the good three-card support|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 3@H is no @D control|pg||
mb|3S|nt|prospero1:  OK, so they are in cuebidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  3@s would be serious slam try if hearts were trump, but I think this is just a normal cuebid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: 3@S is just a cue|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: and 3NT serious|pg||
mb|4C|nt|prospero1:  They need to be careful here ... Rodwell will declare hearts, and a diamond lead will beat anything above the four level|pg||
