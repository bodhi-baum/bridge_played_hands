pc|h8|nt|migry: was it an undo or just a shrinkage of tricks for ew?|pg||
nt|debrose: In answer to some spec commments, I believe it is still "Standard" to lead Ace for unblock, and Queen from KQT9 to ask for unblock of the Jack|pg||
nt|debrose: The latter is clarified on the ACBL convention card, where the Queen is in bold type|pg||
nt|debrose: Something clearly missing from the ACBL convention card which should be there is AKJTx, since this is something everyone needs to discuss and find somewhere to write|pg||

nt|swanson:  It seems that the responder to a two-suit takeout after a 1NT opening should be a bit conservative = don't wish to punish an effective intervention.  So the intervenor needs to be a bit aggressive - I agree with the North game attempt.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this time west showed something -so if now Kamil would have doubled -that would not have been so bad as last board -ok partial but 7 points 4-4 in majors .maybe|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|swanson:  The big difference in doubling last time versus this time is that last hand the opponents were already in	game.  The penalty if you  don't set a doubled partscore is much greater.|pg||

nt|runnerup:  for 12|pg||
nt|swanson:  To be able to ruff the requisite number of spades in hand, dummy needs entries other than trumps.	I think he might take the club finesse the winning way, just to insure entries.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  no need to find @c Q in crossruffing variation|pg||

nt|runnerup:  yes|pg||
nt|kit: just a matter of counting winners -- 7 diamonds (with 2 ruffs in dummy), 1 spade, 3 clubs, 1 heart = 12|pg||
nt|kit: Of course he would still have entry problems, since he couldn't afford to ruff 2 spades in his hand|pg||

nt|runnerup:  as expected 6 @d made in other room for 14 imps |pg||

nt|runnerup:  ns makes 3nt -so .|pg||
nt|swanson:  If the vulnerability were reversed, I would not pass 1@S with the North hand.|pg||
nt|ritong: he has a nice lady|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: Difficult decision.  Problem is that his partner is marked with 3+ hearts pretty much, so not much room left for minor suit length.|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|mb|d|nt|swanson:  Not only does the scoring table not reward nonvul penalties so well, but there is always a little danger that partner will decided not to reopen.|pg||

nt|runnerup:  west can he say some words not mensioned here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I believe good defense holds declarer to 3 tricks here, which is -1400.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  here 3nt can go down -if as ecpected @d q will score|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: I expect declarer to get diamonds right for 2 reasons|pg||
nt|kit: One is if lead from 4-card suit, North more likely to have diamond length|pg||
nt|kit: Other is that if diamond finesse loses, would prefer to lose to South who has more difficult heart shift.|pg||
nt|swanson:  I suspect declarer will get the diamond right.  He doesn't want Norht  shifting to hearts - more difficult for SOuthto lead hearts.|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer is playing North for queen of diamonds, he should take first round finesse rather than cashing king -- cashing king gains only if stiff queen in South hand, first round ...|pg||
nt|kit: finesse gains if stiff small in South hand.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will attack clubs first -- he needs to do this anyway, and gives opponents less information.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|swanson:  Now diamonds the  right way.|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will play another club now.|pg||
nt|kit: As this sets up 2 club tricks, with the 10 having come down.|pg||
nt|kit: Unfortunately for declarer, when he finds out that North has 4 clubs that tilts the odds in the diamond suit the other way.|pg||
nt|kit: So it looks like he may go down after all.|pg||
nt|kit: Remember the defense doesn't know declarer has 5 diamonds, so the heart shift might not be found even if declarer misguesses the diamonds.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: Also, a defender might think declarer started with AJ doubleton of spades.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|ritong: notreally|pg||
nt|kit: No moment of truth -- declarer has only 8 winners on spade shift.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|an|5 spades|nt|dbl me:  How many h's will N risk, if any?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  good 7 @s here -just to make is the problem-@d so badly|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder what 3NT shows?  Does it show 5 spades?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|an|transfer|mb|d|nt|kit: sorry, miscounted -- no grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: exactly 5 spades. Kamil showed me what he alerted|pg||
nt|swanson:  East has the choice of an offbeat 2NT opening or a 1@S opening followed by a 3@C rebid.  I would go for the latter because the hand is so much better in a black suit.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx-all just granny must be seen|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Personally, I'd rather bid hearts than double them with the N hand...|pg||
nt|kit: I think 4@H sets spades trumps for RKC purposes|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ritong: opening 2NT is certainly the best way to bury @cs, right john|pg||
nt|kit: West will locate AKQ of spades (with queen ask), king of diamonds, but no other king, so can only count 12 tricks.|pg||
nt|cherilou: I agree John no reason to distort when you have descriptive rebid|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|kit: This shows king of diamonds along with queen of spades, and no king of clubs|pg||
nt|swanson:  1NT, as ugly as it gets.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  ok -sorry -looks like no pitches -only 6 @S|pg||
nt|kit: West should now bid 6@H, asking for king of hearts|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: wow|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like he just miscounted the tricks -- costly blunder.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Perhaps overly enamored with pd's dK?|pg||
nt|swanson:  Need a heart lead away from the king.  Very difficult to get on this hand,|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so over bid -and i stupitly asked that -sorry Fleisher|pg||
nt|kit: yes, I'm sure that is what happened.|pg||
nt|cherilou: after the 4@H X some play that bidding 4@S shows K--and would pass with Qx to right side lead.|pg||
nt|kit: East is declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: south is on lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: North doubled, so surely has king of hearts|pg||
nt|kit: So declarer would have to hope for squeeze with North having KQ of clubs also.|pg||
