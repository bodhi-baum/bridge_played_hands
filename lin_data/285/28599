nt|Vugraphzfv: he is thinking|pg||
nt|dbl me:  hehe, quite so|pg||
nt|dank: if he does he will have to find the @CQ|pg||
nt|dank: Again, notice Gavin's ultra-aggressive 4@H overcall. 3@H might be considered "normal" but he chose the overbid to put the pressure on|pg||
nt|dbl me:  ...as well he shd after the preempt.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  (find the cQ, that is)|pg||
nt|dank: i think he will go down in 7@D|pg||
nt|dank: he will know gavin has only 7 hearts while he is going about his business|pg||
nt|dbl me:  The 4-0 trump split will prove too much to handle in 7|pg||

nt|dbl me:  yes|pg||
nt|dank: in the other room, Kranyak's team is in 6@H on the previous board, for presumably a big pickup|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Declarer must avoid tapping himself twice, methinks|pg||
nt|dank: to make this declarer can ruff a heart, cash a high diamond, cross to the @CA, ruff a heart, lead dummy's trumps, cash @SA, ruff a spade, and play LHO for @CQ, for the specs who ...|pg||
nt|dank: are asking|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  the 4-0 trump break might mean weinstein makes this|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  under normal circumstances he would find out RHO's complete shape|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|nt|rogerclee:  here he cannot handle ruffing spades, he will find wolpert is 7-0 in the reds but then is on his own|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dank: he might decide that Gavin is likely to be 2=7=0=4 or 4=7=0=2 for his aggressive 4@H call. in which case he may misguess the club suit|pg||
nt|dank: also 3=7=0=3 puts the club queen mathematically as a 60% favourite to be with East.|pg||
nt|dank: however, by this stage in the match, with the aggressive style E/W are playing, I believe that Weinstein will not put too much stock in the 4@H call|pg||
nt|dank: A kib points out that Weinstein may reason that Gavin is likely to have a high spade, thus a hand like @SKxx @HKQxxxxx @D-- @CQxx might have overcalled 1@H.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Weinstein asks about leads:  "3rd and 5th"|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, Levin/Wolpert room|pg||
nt|dank: and therefore guess the club on that basis. But only time will tell. These guys are playing poker at this point|pg||

nt|dank: I suspect East contented himself with a 3@H call in the other room, and South "took the money" and bid 3NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rogerclee:  the 2 of spades is missing, if weinstein notices this it's much more likely lho is hiding it than rho - not for any mathematical reason, but that's just the way people pitch|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfv: lots of joking around and laughing -- Kranyak was glad to see Wein had a spade|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  friendly heart layout means declarer will escape with down 3 i think. weinstein gave suit preference at trick 1 for clubs, but has since corrected with saying he's ok with diamonds too, so defense should be easy at this point|pg||

nt|dank: i guess he has only 8 tricks anyway if he loses a diamond.|pg||

nt|rogerclee:  as it is, on a heart lead, it's on 4-2 diamonds as well as @CKQ+@HK|pg||
nt|dank: 5@D asked for the @SQ, 6@D said "yes I have it and also the @DK, but presumably not the @HK or @CK"|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry - need new spectacles|pg||
nt|dank: thus, I can't see how he can expect there to be a cold grand slam|pg||
nt|dburn: ones with the rose tints removed|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  he knows levin has bid 3@H without KQJ of hearts though|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rogerclee:  well, not quite, but almost|pg||
nt|dank: i suspect he was deciding how likely it was taht a) Gavin had @CQ and b) that the @CK would be onside. finally decided against it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Katz in other room thinking over 6@S on a very different acution|pg||

mc|12|nt|dank: well Kranyak's team has added to its already comfortable lead in this segment, time is running out for the Nickell team. Come back in an hour to see if one of the toughest teams in ...|pg||
nt|dank: the world can make a comeback|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: thanks to the commentators.  We will be back for two more segments of 15 bds in about 1 hour 10 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: As most of you probably know, the winner of this match plays a 120 bd finals to determine USA1.  The loser plays some more to try to qualify as USA2 |pg||
