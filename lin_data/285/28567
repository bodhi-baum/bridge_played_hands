nt|Vugraphzfb: Pepsi asks whether DBL of 1@s by Hamman would have been support (3 @hs) and Hamman says yes|pg||
nt|medwards: That is smashing out the heart ten|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|Vugraphzff: 2NT establishes a GF|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Hurd is allowed to believe his opponents bidding, but he must also believe his partner's.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: this is the 2nd time I've seen Wooldridge do this at this tournament|pg||
nt|medwards: Comic Notrump?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 1NT is either 15-17 or a bad hand with a long minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: it's illegal to play in the ACBL, but this event has WBF regulations|pg||
nt|medwards: Makes more sense|pg||
nt|Henryb:  It is not illegal in Superchart events, which this is|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I'm sure the opponents know|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Hurd wrote something long about 3@C and then took it back. Berkowitz is writing something long too.|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|medwards: Was not alerted is it a pre alert?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: It wasn't alerted; they don't play it as far as I'm aware.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: at this point, both Berk and Sontag know what's going on and it's likely they're just deciding between doubling and bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|Henryb:  N-S are now in 1100 territory|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|Vugraphzff: Fielder's choice if you will|pg||
nt|medwards: Exactly|pg||
nt|Henryb:  1700 if they stay in 3@h|pg||
nt|Henryb:  1400 in 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|medwards: Why do this in a close match?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Yes, he doesn't know about the double game swing and slam swing. N-S have had a reasonable card so far.|pg||
nt|Henryb:  because he doesn't know it is close and doesn't know its the wrong hand to do it on|pg||
nt|medwards: But he has a very good pair at the other table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bark wants to trust his partner, but red v white when you have a stiff King is hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Hurd has basically admitted something funny is going on|pg||
nt|medwards: Maybe I am old fashion, but I just play the best I can|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  But when you (or I) play the best we can do we do as well as any of these guys?|pg||
nt|medwards: Good point|pg||
mb|6D|nt|medwards: But you are a very good player|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  Never quite in this league|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: now it would be silly to force Hurd to double here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Berkowitz hopes this auction never occurs again|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: although I saw a more bizarre one last night|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Berk can make this, and the auction sort of told him how|pg||
nt|medwards: Maybe at one time in another life \, like 30 years ago|pg||
