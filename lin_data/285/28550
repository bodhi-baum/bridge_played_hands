mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|prospero1:  Kranyak-Wolpert play 2/1, Meckwell, of course, play their custom precision system|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtmckee: about 2 too high|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|medwards: Not sure four hearts is correct with stiff diamond|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|c2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|medwards: Apparently, North had two aces and did not double|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Their overcalls are aggressive, and looking at six diamonds, the void may have been with E|pg||
nt|medwards: True|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Only really worth doubling if you beat them 2+, and that seems a little remote|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jtmckee: down 2 should be easy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Wolpert: "i got to admit I didn' think you were thinking about your discard"|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Rodwell should know that eventually Wolpert can get to the table in spades, so no point in not starting clubs|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Unless Meckstroth has six spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 9-2 in hearts by Rodwell prob suggest club card -- they play upsidedown suit pref I think|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Yes, they do ... in other contexts they play reverse Smith in the trump suit|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Not on a trump lead, though|pg||
nt|prospero1:  I played with Sylvia Shi against them in Richmond ... we try to play their entire system, including the carding|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cT|nt|prospero1:  We defended a trump contract, and after I led, Rodwell asked Sylvia what our signale were ...|pg||

nt|medwards: Did you beat them?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|prospero1:  No, lost by 7 ... we had beaten them by 9 in the three-way the night before, but there was no carryover|pg||
mb|2S|nt|prospero1:  So, 1@s limited to 15 by failure to open 1@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|prospero1:  2@s would be constructive without interference, but after the overcall is wide-ranging|pg||
nt|medwards: It is always good to play the best competition available if you want to compete on that level|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  I really enjoy playing them ... they have always been pleasant, but tough as nails|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Meckstroth makes a game try, since Rodwell could easily have a good 9 count|pg||

nt|medwards: Yes!|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Wolpert's nine must be an upside-down count signal|pg||
nt|jtmckee: i am pretty sure the Kranyak team does not feel they are underdogs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Meck asking about carding -- Russinow, 3/5 always for EW|pg||
nt|jtmckee: maybe by the betting line|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Some pairs, including Meckwell, switch to standard count and attitude at trick one in response to an AK lead|pg||
nt|medwards: True, you can not go in with a losing attitude|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|prospero1:  If Kranyak are underdogs now, they won't be at some point in the future|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|medwards: OK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|prospero1:  So Meckstroth has to decide whether to force a diamond entry to play for honor doubleton of spade onside, or ...|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Simply play A and hope for 32 spades or a singleton honor offside|pg||
nt|prospero1:  It looks like the 41 spade split and lack of dummy entry will scuttle this contract|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Even if he guesses the spades, he will be tapped in clubs again when Wolpert gets in ...|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||

nt|jtmckee: might have been better to throw a diamond on easts club return|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Meck asking about what other bids over 2@S would have meant|pg||
nt|prospero1:  If Meckstroth could have seen through the backs of the cards, he could have cashed the @sA and led three hearts to pitch dummy's club ...|pg||
nt|prospero1:  protecting himself from the second tap|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|Vugraphzfe: Meck showing his hand to Kranyak suggesting the hand is over is Kran has Kx of spades left.  Kran says nothing.|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Kranyak has higher visions here|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Wolpert will be discouraged by no three-card support for either of Kranyak's suits|pg||
nt|prospero1:  6@c is the best slam|pg||
nt|medwards: They could bid six spades where every thing works|pg||
mb|4H|nt|prospero1:  Either black slam makes because of the favorable layout, but 6@c is better ... just requires 42 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  two cuebids, I imaginem now 5N is choice of slams|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  This is the wrong one ... but Wolpert rescues him|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Wolpert knows at best opposite honor doubleton|pg||
nt|medwards: Is he thinking of seven!|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Well, he can make it if he bids it|pg||
nt|prospero1:  But a very poor choice given they may not be in slam in the other room, and in fact are not|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Earler in the auction, wouldn't Wolpert have bid 3@h with 6? Then why offer 6@h?|pg||
