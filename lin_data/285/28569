nt|ybob: best spot is 2/3@S for E-W|pg||
mb|d|an|!|mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, doubling 2@d would mean " i had a penalty pass of 1@s" but here, the fact that west doubled 1NT perhaps changes this standard acceptance|pg||

nt|reisig: 2@s now ...GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I bet Pass|pg||
nt|ybob: only pass then |pg||
nt|ritong: the hand certainly "stinks"|pg||
nt|ritong: but east can expect a better hand with pard, maybe|pg||
nt|reisig: :) yes|pg||
nt|ybob: W hand could be more strong so not a clear bid by E|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S and later Â·@S is GF too RR ?|pg||

nt|reisig: Fred is learning |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Fred didn't hesitate...instant lead|pg||
nt|ritong: the snag might be like QJx in dummy|pg||
nt|phil: and reasonable for Rosenberg to duck - S can have @hQ, @dQ, @c card|pg||

nt|phil: misunderstanding about Zia's double in the other room? |pg||
nt|phil: or was he just being Zia? |pg||
nt|ritong: for instance, after making 1@d doubled, you can ask " how much is this?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss called the director|pg||
nt|reisig: 1@d X ...is the final contract??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: something about Willenken's double and how many diamonds he had|pg||

nt|phil: can you call the director because you don't approve of your opponent's bidding? |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: meanwhile, I will tell you something curious/funny (at least for me). This morning Willenken brought a jar of water to the table, now he brought a jar of coffee THE jar ;)|pg||

nt|migry: as someone suggested, declarer may be able to endplay south in a 3 card ending |pg||

nt|ritong: when declarer has three touching honors, he generally has interest to take the first trick with the middle one|pg||
nt|migry: right you are. win the highest from 2 equals, the middle from 3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|migry: it creates most confusion for the defense|pg||

nt|migry: great play by MR at trick 4|pg||
nt|ritong: south knows that east knows that he has the @d A|pg||

nt|ritong: when noth is marked with @h AH and the @s K|pg||
nt|migry: i think it is a problem, would south think with AJx? don't forget that south doesn't know about the H honors and E may have a stiff @d|pg||
nt|ritong: right drew  however, taking his time does not disclose anything|pg||
