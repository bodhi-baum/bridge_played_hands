mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:	Yes, he has a tough call ... it's not clear whether partner is balanced |pg||

nt|vugrapha1: may be he wants more|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Still, I think Justin did the right thing.  If partner doesn't have something in spades, then his hand is totally worthless in 3NT|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And if partner DOES have something in spades, then 4@S might be ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, the weaker North's spades are, the more important it is to play in spades. Maybe that's an oxymoron, but it makes some sense.|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  Well, in my current system, it depends on whether partner opened 1@C or 1@D, but I'll say this ...|pg||
