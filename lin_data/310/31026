mb|p|nt|djneill:  Del'Monte likes this - the hand has some useful fillers for East's 3 suits|pg||
nt|timb: The worst auction I have ever seen is 3@S from my partner, 6@S from me and 7@S from partner: all 7@S needed was that the six outstanding clubs split 2-2, which thanks to some ...|pg||
nt|timb: injudicious discarding they did...|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  any clues as to the @sQ?|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  sounds like opps have something in both majors, maybe best to lead passive club|pg||
pc|d9|nt|loganrun:  Or through the known singleton with good ish diamonds as was done|pg||
nt|djneill:  would be nice to be able to throw someone in, but too mirrored|pg||

nt|djneill:  North might pitch the @hK under the @hA to give declarer a 2-way guess, but that would be suspicious when they followed to the 2nd heart low |pg||
nt|vugrapha2: Also Ware has actually played a spade here, got his discard wrong earlier.|pg||
nt|loganrun:  He always needs the spade finesse for 12 tricks and throwing a spade now and finesse the heart means they both must be right and/or guessed|pg||
