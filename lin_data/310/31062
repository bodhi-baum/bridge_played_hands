nt|petergill: Why no results at other table: the rumour is: a player at that table complained of loud clicking by BBO operator, so BBO coverage at that table has been limited|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|petergill: about minus 200 - North not being one who passes when she can bid|pg||

nt|petergill: EW might have doubled this - due to state of the match|pg||

nt|petergill: East's double (alas for EW) would have been Penalty, so East could hardly double. |pg||
mc|6|nt|petergill: that's all, folks|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to operators Chris Rhodes and Erin Tewes|pg||
nt|petergill: Lorna Ichilcik and Lynn Kalmin, almost certainly the best female pair in Australia who have not (yet) played for Australia, win the SNWT with Paula McLeish (ex-NZ) and Jan Cormack ...|pg||
nt|petergill: (NZ)|pg||
nt|petergill: bye everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 28 will cost McLeish about 5 imps (1@C being played at other table) so they will win by about 40 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 27 was 9 imps to Mcleish so they win by about 50 imps|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 27, South did not open 1@H (should have), and EW played 2@S, minus one |pg||
nt|petergill: That's all, bye|pg||
