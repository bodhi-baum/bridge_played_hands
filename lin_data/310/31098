mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|gio 89: wise choice to pass, in my opinion :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good rule of thumb is that when the opponents open a strong notrump, don't look for thin games, look for best part score., not least non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|gio 89: whenever partners is interested in game he can always bid 2@D (relays asking fo longer major) and then raise that major to showw invitational values|pg||

nt|gio 89: allright, so almost a push |pg||
nt|gio 89: 1imp to greece|pg||
nt|petergill: This is Round 4. Greece leads after 3 rounds, Bulgaria 2nd. 26 teams, from as far away (from Paris) as Botswana and Uruguay|pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|mb|p|mb|3S|an|p/c|mb|3N|mb|4H|nt|gio 89: assuming 2@D is some kind of Multi and 3@S preemptive in @S or forcing to 4@H is partners has @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What a result Bulgaria has in the closed room.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D Multi  - 3@S Pass or Correct |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|gio 89: I think S can afford to do a take out double here, after partner bid 3NT|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But is double for takeout?|pg||
nt|gio 89: it isn't? as you said yesterday Roland, junior now adays play take out double to the 7 level :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@HX would be 500 or 800 on very best defence (spade ruff!)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It sounds logical. Make sure you have an agreement when it comes up in 2019.|pg||
nt|gio 89: I think X would show a hand very similar to this, some values and availability to play in at least 2 out of 3 other suits. partners can pass if he thinks it is best.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know what 4NT would be, minors.|pg||
nt|gio 89: you know that opponents most likely have 10trums between them. hard to play penalty doubles when opponents have so many trumps, I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I agree with you, Giorgia, double should show cards and short hearts.|pg||
nt|gio 89: but anyways, seems like the understood eachother and landed in the right spot :)|pg||
nt|petergill: If EW manage to make no bids at all on this hand, NS might stop in a part-score (or a failing 3NT), but Juniors at fav vulnerability not bidding at all = never happens?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, is 4NT natural or for the minors? We had that discussion yesterday, did we not?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not exactly the same auction, but similar.|pg||
nt|gio 89: we did :) i think it is for me minors here, same reason as above|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: After a natural 3NT, I think 4NT is natural|pg||
nt|gio 89: opponents have (9)10 trumps and partners has a balanced hang|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|gio 89: how can i really have a hand that wants to play 4nt? pd might not even have @H stopper|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You can play anything you like, the important thing, as always, is that you and your partner are on the same page.|pg||

nt|gio 89: as we said yesterday, I am a senior junior :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Is the 2nd Dbl t/o or penalty?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You could persuade me to open 1@S with AKQ10.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, when you play Fantunes (N-S do), it's not a good idea to psyche.|pg||
nt|gio 89: that shows that you are still a junior inside Roland|pg||
nt|petergill: West thinking |pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: yes|pg||
mb|4S|nt|petergill: 4@HX looks like 500|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gio 89: if vovos finds the strenght to double...|pg||
nt|gio 89: eheh|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S looks like about "minus 200"|pg||
nt|gio 89: he couldn't, still not a bad result for NS most likely|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Here we have it again. Vasilev really wanted double of 4@H to be penalties, but it's not in modern bridge.|pg||
nt|gio 89: nice result coming for greece from CR where EW menaged to make 9 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: the advantage of bidding 2@H then 4@H on "nothing much" is that even when you are caught for penalties, the opponents might remove a penalty dbl.... not being sure if it is t/o or ...|pg||

nt|petergill: there is a reasonably good case for leading @HQ to 3NT, in my opinion|pg||
nt|gio 89: we finally agree peter ;)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but hard for South to imagine that partner did not even have the 10 when he bid hearts twice.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand his low heart.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|gio 89: true, but if partners has 4@Hs, it really can't hurt to lead the Q|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|petergill: Sofios played 4@S well, leading @C10 from dummy at one stage, covered by the jack|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlucky to have two spade losers, but lucky to have no club loser. So that evens out.|pg||
nt|gio 89: having KJ@C inside makes this game cold|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|gio 89: but still have to be carefully played|pg||
nt|vugraphzbd: east closed the screen ... again|pg||
nt|gio 89: as always :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually when @C10 is played from dummy and you have KJxx or even KJ8x, either the king or low is the best defence, not the jack|pg||
nt|gio 89: definitely, jack leaves no doubt|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|nt|gio 89: even though when you have to make every trick in that suit, you have no doubt either way... KJ must be on :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  when north is in he should switch to a @c -declarer migth missplay -ok also this may lead for -|pg||
nt|petergill: Vovos is correct not to double - the doubler at the other table was lucky his trumps were over the ace, else it would be 690|pg||
nt|gio 89: not a good idea to give declarer even more info (2@S already gave away quite few info) if you are not 100% sure they are going down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South could have singleton jack, and that might persuade declarer to insert the queen. That's why I think it's best to follow small when the 10 is advanced.|pg||
nt|petergill: @C10 from dummy is better play than small club from dummy - puts more pressure on defence|pg||
nt|gio 89: after 4@C bid I think S would have sacrificied in 5of a minor if he had 6-5|pg||
nt|gio 89: so after you see sing @s, maybe more likely for him to have 2@C, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed it is.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S was Michaels, hearts and minor. 4@C was pass or correct, suggesting 4+ cards in each minor|pg||
nt|petergill: If South had singleton club, he might have switched to or led it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another inference.|pg||
nt|gio 89: if he had 2trumps, for sure...|pg||
nt|petergill: so East thinks South is probably 1552 shape, but might be 2551, with singleton club honour|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gio 89: anyways it looks like all roads lead to KJ@C inside instead of stiff honour|pg||

pc|sT|pc|d7|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We shall see, but I think he will get it right.|pg||
nt|petergill: south has top diamonds for the @D honour lead, so North probably has @CK to make 4@C bid|pg||
nt|gio 89: must play @C now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I just hope that Vovos does not cover the 10 with the jack - if in fact the 10 is advanced.|pg||
nt|gio 89: or he will be late in tempo|pg||
nt|petergill: entries to dummy mean club play needs to be made NOW|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: This is an interesting hand. If you go to slam, it's important that you choose 6@C rather than 6@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is also the superior slam.|pg||
nt|petergill: which probably had an effect on their decisions, even though 3Nt survives from either side as the cards lay|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S is GF with 5+ spades.|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Fantunes system|pg||
nt|gio 89: CR 6@H-1, chose wrong slam|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@C is better because you have the ruffing finesse in spades as a last resort if hearts are 4-1.|pg||
nt|gio 89: not so easy to reach 6@C though|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: it may seem that @C are needed to pitch something|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: lucky board for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not from North's point of view. He does not need picthes.|pg||
nt|gio 89: but we will take it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is better for two reasons - the 2nd being that it avoids a possible club ruff (more likely than a heart ruff in 6@C)|pg||
nt|gio 89: true, but it will probably be S deciding in the end|pg||
