nt|ady: this will not be among the 70 percent	and there are cases where doubling allows opps to run to 3 of a minor  which was not  possible|pg||

nt|ady: otherwise winnging team gets 2 pts and losers nil|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ady: not sure when the diference is less than 20 pts regarding pt a board|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North has various bids now to show spade support. 3@S seems normal over a double.|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|vugraphzep: 10 points difference is a tie|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: the pts accumulated for pt a board are added to the imps and then converted in to victory pts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|BroLucius:  A friend of mine, Simon Cocheme, said he was doing some VG operating at this event. Don't know if we are benefiting from his services at this table.|pg||
