mb|1D|nt|mrdct:  one theory is that nothing can ever go wrong at favourable vul when you have a fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mrdct:  butr sometimes it does|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor:  partner's hand was outside the "normal" range|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  pushy 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but i don't think it can be beaten|pg||
nt|mwigor:  i'd describe it as a normal 3NT|pg||
nt|mwigor:  15 opposite 9|pg||
nt|mwigor:  west has an easy raise to 3NT opposite a 1NT overcall (in my opinion) - the opening bid makes it easier to play the hand|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but west has only invited and east doesn't really have anything special to accept an invite|pg||
nt|mwigor:  indeed - an opportunity for fleischer in the other room perhaps|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i guess his @d holding his nice and he has lots of 10s ans 9s|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mwigor:  3 tens is a good excuse for overbidding|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mwigor:  rosenberg made 10 tricks in the other room on the (in my opinion more normal) 1NT-3NT auction|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i don't know a lot about EW's style but perhaps west is known to be a bit conservative|pg||
nt|mwigor:  declarer has 4 club tricks, 2 diamond tricks, 3 hearts tricks and a spade trick|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|mrdct:  we had a tie in one of the round of 16 matches with playoff boards and we frequently see major matches decided by an imp|pg||

nt|mrdct:  so now south needs to devine this 1@c position with a vul game swing at stake|pg||

nt|mrdct:  can we squeeze north in the Majors perhaps?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  might be strip squeeze on where north needs to pitch to a position where he gets endplayed|pg||

nt|mrdct:  both 1@d and NT will be played by east now of course|pg||
nt|mwigor:  theres no slam of any sort on this hand - the 11th trick is @hQ- and theres no squeeze for a 12th|pg||
