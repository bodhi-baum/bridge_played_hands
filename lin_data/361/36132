mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|CorpLaw:  Rosenberg didn't play for spade finesse, because E would have opened in third seat with KS, AKC and JH.  so only hope was that spade K was stiff with W|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H = @H	 and THAT is why Rosenberg didn't overcall on that earlier hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: just realized i was looking at Fleisher-Martel defense to 1N instead of Rosenberg-Willenken|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  still S must find 4 discards on @d first|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like he has to play the king of hearts -- he has no play anyway if ace offside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if bbo score is to be believed  it will be Monao over Lebron by 2 or 1|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  if S has no @hA, he should have both Kings - no chance to win|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but there were so many room crashes -- i wouldn't trust any bbo score at this point|pg||
nt|CorpLaw:  unless N had stiff A, but playing K seems percentage|pg||
nt|kit: After king of hearts wins, then declarer will have to guess ending|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|kit: he probably should cash one of the black aces before running the diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Web page is now showing bridgemate scores|pg||
