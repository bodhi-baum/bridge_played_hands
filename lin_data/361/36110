nt|roghog:  Brilliant stuff!|pg||
nt|kit: he may have been planning on finessing anyway.	We will never know.|pg||
nt|kit: He is looking for safest play -- but after all is said and done I think he has to take double spade finesse and hope he isn't losing to stiff jack|pg||
nt|roghog:  Defender's reaction often helps when you lead a Q in a position like this|pg||
nt|kit: He can the take 7 diamond tricks, 3 spade tricks, and 2 aces|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|kit: I think he is trying to strip West's hearts, so if he does lose to stiff jack West is end-played|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: Would be dangerous if West has only 2 hearts, but is that possible?|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, West might have 7 clubs|pg||
nt|kit: So he may compromise with jack of diamonds, ace of hearts, spade finesse|pg||
