nt|atabey: its a matter if 1@c opening is a suit or not|pg||
nt|MrAce:  that could possibly be pretty expensive choice of leads to lead anything but 4 from something like QT84 Henri, but if they are leading strictly the 3rd regardless of what they hold, you are right|pg||

nt|MrAce:  without this lead declarer had at least % 50 chanc of making the correct play in @Ds if not more due to info he gets during the play|pg||
