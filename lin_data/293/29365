nt|Vugraphzff: The table is taking a restroom break, so will be back shortly.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|chip: much to be said for DBL then 3N to suggest more flexibility. If partner is 1-5 in the majors don't want to play 3N.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Zwerling also started with strong 1@C  but Tolliver's positive response was 1N|pg||
