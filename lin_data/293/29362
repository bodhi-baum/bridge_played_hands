nt|3for3:  next is a very strong hand opposite an 8 bagger|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Short break|pg||
nt|3for3:  slam is on a hook, which happens to work|pg||
nt|3for3:  oh, south only has 2 hearts...|pg||
nt|3for3:  so need hook and 2-1 break|pg||
nt|3for3:  hook yes, 2-1 break, no|pg||

nt|3for3:  if the defense fails to cash the diamond at trick 1 the slam might come in|pg||

nt|pbundy: and at the other - the auction began with a big club, 1@D negative response and an alert with 1@H from north.  |pg||
