nt|agumperz:  wd u bid 2NT or 1@H Bob?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|agumperz:  on the south cards|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	I like 1@H - the club spots are terrible, and this is neither a weak nor strong hand|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|agumperz:  I also prefer 1@H to 2NT. The South hand has good defense. 2NT might convince partner to take a bad sacrifice.|pg||

mb|1D|an|2+|mb|4H|nt|kareno:  Here's a wild hand|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	at the other table, S started with an eccentric weak two|pg||

nt|BobThomson:	it went 2@D - 4@H - 5@D - 5@H - 6@D - 6@H, undoubled down two|pg||
mb|5D|nt|reisig: 5@d is enough :)|pg||

nt|kareno:  Yes but will east let it go?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|kareno:  PPass encouraging by south|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|kareno:	Okay, specs, Richie (@h) I'm leaving now.|pg||
nt|reisig: Thx Karen@H|pg||
nt|kareno:  missing 2, cards, without indications, it's 52 percent to play for the split 1-1|pg||

mb|2D|mb|4H|nt|agumperz:  Its been a very strong set for Lynch|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|nt|BobThomson:  What a wild hand!  A kibitzer called this a "goulash" hand.  That's a form of party bridge where you don't shuffle and deal bunches of cards together.|pg||
nt|agumperz:  which creates extreme distributions|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	South is overstrength for his weak two, and he's got a void in hearts.	I think he has to bid again.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|6H|nt|BobThomson:  North isn't sure he can beat this...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|agumperz:	he does have a side ace and king|pg||

nt|agumperz:  thanks all|pg||
nt|agumperz:  and see u for the next session!|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	a kibitzer points out that declarer might have ruffed a smal spade instead to try to catch Kx in either hand|pg||
nt|BobThomson:	On board 11, Wold made an overtrick in 3NT to win another 11 IMPs.|pg||
