nt|ahollan1: 2N =  @C & @D, (5+/4+), less than opening|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: leaving Jan in Orlando to fend for herself|pg||
nt|chip: not exactly what W was hoping for.  3H looks questionable to me, though OK.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even without interference 3@S = nat, F1|pg||
nt|chip: That is 2N opening. W has a guess since no idea of partner's Major length (if some hearts, DBL is appealing now).|pg||
nt|chip: Bidding spades works well here, but imagine partner with 1-2 in the majors.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: N is surprised by the DBL.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  Kit's defence to this type of opener is interesting, uses a multi 3@d to show a weaker 3M overcall, allowing 3M to be a decent hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chip: I use 3D to show majors with longer spades (3C with equal or longer hearts). With a major can P then bid, bid, or DBL then bid to show ranges.|pg||

nt|chip: BAd trump break beats 4H, and bad club break beats 4S if EW get their ruff(s).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|chip: A of hearts is a very unfortunate lead as it loses tempo for club ruffs and stops EW from tapping declarer without setting up a H trick.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller:  your guess on 3NT, Chip?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip: I guess 3N is T/O (1D was precison, so S doesn't know what minor he has), but not sure that is an agreed meaning.|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller:  Seems right :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chip: I'm told W led the heart 9 in the other room, so now could tap declarer without setting up a trick (by having E leasd hearts).|pg||
nt|smoller:  Can South be shortened (enough) in hearts?|pg||
nt|chip: On this lead if they lead hearts twice declarer can take 5 spades, 4 clubs and a heart for 10.|pg||
nt|smoller:  yes, @H9 opens possibilties to tap decalrer - clever lead|pg||
nt|chip: yes, good lead as long as no stiff K out.|pg||
