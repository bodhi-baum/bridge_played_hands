nt|ahollan1: http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/3b.htm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Like last session, E-W is using option 2.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's link to ACBL recommended defense which NS MUST provide to their opponents -- who are allowed to refer to notes during the auction|pg||
nt|warrens:  option 1 would allow East to make a takeout of @H's.  with option 2, I think he has to pass with this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they must decide which option is used BEFORE session begins  [not after seeing a hand that favors one over the other]|pg||

nt|warrens:  he doesn't want to pass for fear of all pass, so he doubled to show some values or a very strong hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: PASS forces North to reveal his number of @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: That's what Woolsey wrote for Passell|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: if 3+@D  they play 2@DX  otherwise Stewart will show short @D AND identify his major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the 2@D opener often contains a 5-card major	especially non-vul|pg||
nt|warrens:  3@C?  I've never seen that before|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Option 2 says  3@C = Stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess based on the assumption that DBL = BAL 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Option 2    west's 2N would show @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Since Pass here implies P/C, in this context I would think Stayman applies.  At least Passell thinks so.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but Passell has tough problem in context of Woolsey's PASS being  only somewhat forcing/enlightening|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 11-15 HCP, 4415 minus 1 card, NF  [Precision 2@D]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Last hand of this segment.  I'd like to thank Al and Warren for commentating, and our wonderful spectators as well.|pg||
mb|2H!|an|11-15 HCP, (4415) -1 card|nt|warrens:  thanks Chase and thank you for handling the VuGraph, no easy task|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th and final set of the day  scheduled to begin in about 20 minutes  -- but 2 15 board sets tomorrow to complete USA1 SemiFinal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This is Mid-chart as well, so Hayden asks for Defense|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: http://web2.acbl.org/defensedatabase/1a.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: [then 2 15-board sets to start USA1 Final]|pg||
nt|warrens:  will Woolsey invite in @S's or at least make an asking bid?  might depend on East's action|pg||
nt|warrens:  ..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I will bet on the double here|pg||
nt|warrens:  East might X, but he might also bid 3@D natural or 3@C, which some players use as a stronger version of 3@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4415 minus 1 card means	 subtract 1 card from any suit to get hand with 13 cards  so  3415  4315 4405 or 4414|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He can also pass, and when Kit bids @S, X that for takeout|pg||
nt|warrens:  a lot of players use 3@C as artificial here, since opener has 5@C's quite often and overcalling in @C's isn't usually a good idea|pg||
nt|warrens:  in my opinion, he's not really worth a strong bid and I would bid 3@D natural if available in their partnership|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Warren  you mean something like 3@C = good 3@D bid and 3@D is less encouraging?|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, so 3@D might be an opening hand with 6@D's and 3@C would be 18+ with @D's|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Schwartz leads Street by 99 and change|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Stewart - "Sorry everyone, I'm still thinking about my opening bid"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  think of xx, xx, AQJxxx, Axx versus  AJx, Kx, AQJxxx, Kx|pg||

nt|warrens:  ok, problem solved|pg||
pc|hT|nt|warrens:  Hayden must have decided to make a balancing X over 2@S if that came back to him|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: does cover with @HQ obfuscate the @H position??|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit seems to think so|pg||

mc|9|nt|ahollan1: in this situation partnerships need to know what opener will play on 2nd round if original lead was T9x(x) rather than  Tx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: short break then 4th of 6th set|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back shortly with the 4th segment.  See you all then!|pg||
