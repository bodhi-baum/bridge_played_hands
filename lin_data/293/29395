nt|kareno:  Matt @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Players are finished discussing methods and are now underway|pg||
mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfk: An action hand right out of the gate here, a big chance for a pickup for Kasle|pg||
mb|p!|nt|kareno:  NNice slam in clubs e/w.  A save even over 7@c available n/s.  Some fireworks I predict|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno:  And 7 nt with a red-suit squeeze e/w|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|kareno:  East's pass is standard expert treatment these days to SHOW values, so west's pass was forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: This contract will not take long to play, a good start to this session given that the time police were a regular visitor to our table last segment :)|pg||

nt|joest:  7@c is pretty reasonable here|pg||
nt|joest:  you need diamonds 3-3|pg||
nt|joest:  or the clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|joest:  here the 3rd chance of a remote squeeze occurs|pg||
nt|kareno:  Both grands actually depend on the red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|joest:  not 7@c if either minor breaks|pg||

nt|kareno:  Specs, always play the last trumps in this sort of position |pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+!d 11-15|mb|d|nt|joest:  several possible choices with teh south hand|pg||
nt|kareno:  n/s playing forcing club system so 1@d is just a squeak to indicate an opening bid of some sort.|pg||
nt|joest:  but if you can be facing a doubleton diamond there are fewer than in standard|pg||
nt|joest:  Wold mayjust redouble (assuming that is not a transfer)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Redouble would be a transfer |pg||
nt|joest:  Kozlove dealt a perfect t/o double|pg||
nt|kareno:  SSouth, of course, has no idea if north really has diamonds|pg||
mb|1S!|an|transfer to 1nt|nt|joest:  I believe some Precision pairs play 3@c here (over the double) as both minors.|pg||
nt|joest:  so they wre playing transfers|pg||
nt|joest:  and Wold, in effect, bids 1NT|pg||
nt|joest:  this brings up an interesting partnership discussion for east west|pg||
nt|joest:  what is the difference between doubling 1@s and bidding 2@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Both minors less than invitational would be 3@c, he felt a bit too strong for that, and given the major suit values etc.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|joest:  yes too strong is the problem|pg||
nt|joest:  that's why he rejected it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno:  SSo e/w picked up a slam swing when their counterparts missed any slam in the CR board 16|pg||
nt|joest:  I am a bit surprised Kasle did not compete in either spades or diamonds|pg||
nt|joest:  i mean in spades sorry|pg||
nt|kareno:  I would have doubled one spade to show spades, Jack - you?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|joest:  if i were going to act directly at all (a big if), I would double 1@s yes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest:  leading low from KQ9x is always risky and even more so against a Precision pair that often has clubs on the side after opening 1@d|pg||
nt|kareno:  East really under pressure after 1NT - his hand isn't good enough to compete further.  It's up to west|pg||
nt|joest:  they can make, or come close to 2@s|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|joest:  if the bids it, I suspect Wold woudl bid 2NT or double or something that would elicit 3@d from north|pg||

pc|d9|nt|joest:  yes it much easier to analyze these when you see all 4 hands|pg||
pc|dT|pc|hT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|joest:  playing for hearts 3-3 risked going -200 or so|pg||
nt|Henryb:  So it is, Jack|pg||
nt|kareno:  Now he's got to lose two heart tricks - you're so right, Jack|pg||
nt|joest:  it is a tough situation to stroke these 4-3 fits red :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: true enough, although the diference between +110 and -110 is greater than the difference between -100 and -200|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Henryb:  Another 26 point game that will be difficult to make|pg||
nt|joest:  Jacobus almost certainly a 1@h overcall|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest:  it is hard to find 4-4 spades after that|pg||
mb|2D|nt|joest:  i tried using Michaels with hands like that until my partners begged me to stop :)|pg||
nt|kareno:  Diamonds unfriendly and that spade queen not pulling its weight.|pg||
nt|joest:  some play "leaping Flannery" so that 2@d there would be 4S and 5H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  :) was that me? Oh wait, we have never played together :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  i don't mind Flannery.  I know that makes me an outcast on BBO|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest:  I suspect Jacobus will try spades here|pg||
nt|kareno:  Jack I play Flannery in my four card major systems - it works very well.  I like it just fine|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|joest:  don't know if the 9 is "Rusinow" or "0 or 2 higher"|pg||
nt|Henryb:  That is a treatment of which I have never heard|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|joest:  actually the 2@d overcall over 1C is pretty useless as a preempt|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|joest:  and finding spades after you overcall 1@h is tough so it is a convention with utility imho|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kareno:  LLeaping Flannery?  I've heard of it, like it but haven't used it.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kareno:  YET|pg||
nt|joest:  5 spades and 4 hearts is easy to get unwound but not the other way around|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Until they use it against you and you have an eight count with a useful five card major and a doubleton in the other|pg||
nt|joest:  nothings perfect|pg||
nt|joest:  so let's see here|pg||
nt|kareno:  Well done by Kasle to play the diamonds this way (with no dummy entry.  |pg||
nt|joest:  if he ducks the diamond|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Henryb:  he has eight tricks: which he still has|pg||
pc|cA|nt|joest:  he wasn't making it ducking the @d either|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|joest:  so this gets him to 3 clubs + 3 diamonds + 2 spades|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno:  Well, so much for my predictions.  I thought he'd find nine this way... four diamonds, two spades, two clubs and a heart???  |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Henryb:  He would lose two spades, two hearts and a diamond along the way|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno:  North and south both under pressure now - endplay in spades after the last club |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Henryb:  North has to unblock the @sK under the A|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Good play at trick 2 by Passell, creating an extra @C trick and a possible entry if a @C isn't led back.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|joest:  with clubs 3-3 everything makes|pg||
nt|kareno:  I imagine east will make a slam try and west will decline|pg||
nt|joest:  i agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|Henryb:  I think E should just bid slam. afterall, partner could have three clubs, or the @cJ instead of the @sJ|pg||
nt|kareno:  Perhaps even the same auction as the other room, east showing clubs and a slammish hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  and he won't know how to ealuate either of those|pg||
nt|kareno:  Bearing in mind that when you bid a slam, you give up a game, Henry - there's a price to guessing these hands out|pg||
nt|joest:  would you at least check for aces Henry?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Henryb:  probably not: you have at least 32 HCK|pg||
nt|Henryb:  HCP|pg||
nt|joest:  agree.  plus there is no way to do that! :)|pg||
nt|kareno:  3@c now natural and forcing and if west doesn't cooperate, he hasn't got a fit|pg||
nt|joest:  over Kasle's 3NT comes the decision.  4NT or Henry's 6NT|pg||
nt|joest:  there is alot to what you say Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|Henryb:  is Jx a fit?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kareno:  More than xx|pg||
nt|joest:  With an AKQxx suit partner won't be able to evaluate Jx or such (or even xxx) as helpful|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: This is one of those hands where a slightly different NT range (14 16 for lynch passell) 15-17 here create a "system" swing of sorts, hard to blame either table|pg||
nt|joest:  yes also true|pg||
nt|joest:  maybe even Henry would only invite opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: minimum of 32 high sort of indicates a jump to 6nt where opposite a 14-16 east as a quanitative bid and west rejected with an average 15|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  Kozlove-Bethe: the partnership of the future|pg||
nt|kareno:  A very good point, Matt|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Although if you play 14-16, the W hand is a maximum imo|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfk: It's certainly not a minimum, but if the idea of those kinds of invites is to "accept" with non-minimums, i would agree|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||

nt|kareno:  BBut he refuses :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Gaylor shrugs and seemed to give little creedence to the J@c|pg||
nt|Henryb:  I think you should get your diamond trick|pg||
nt|joest:  get your diamond|pg||
nt|Henryb:  then play clubs with the spade finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|kareno:  Definitely knock out the diamond before testing clubs|pg||
nt|joest:  playing clubs first you could go down if the hand with th ace of diamonds has four clubs|pg||
nt|Henryb:  4@s, 4@h, 1@d, and 3@c = 12|pg||
nt|kareno:  Exactly.  Compound your chances - first club break, then spade finesse if needed but first diamond |pg||
nt|Henryb:  It really is a pretty good slam|pg||
nt|joest:  there is zero chance Gaylor gets this wrong|pg||
nt|joest:  i agree with you Henry|pg||
