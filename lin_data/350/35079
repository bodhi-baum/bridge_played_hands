nt|ahollan1: fwiw  KnR [Kaplan Rubens evaluation]   AKx Jx  instead of AK Jxx  raises value of the hand by 0.60|pg||

nt|kit: North's hand is so slammish opposite a diamond fit that I do agree with the 2@D call.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but on actual hand  all roads lead to 4@S	 still	I think interesting discussion point|pg||
nt|Mbodell:  Since N knows he wants to force to game I think he can know he'll show spades next, unless @D get supported|pg||
nt|kareno: And if diamonds are supported there is likely to be a slam lurking|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like declarer's main play is to establish the diamond suit, losing perhaps 1 diamond and 2 trumps in the process.|pg||
