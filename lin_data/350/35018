nt|kit: South might bid 2NT showing he can play a minor, and that will be all North needs|pg||

nt|jkdood: On the previous hand 4@S was found, but went for -500 due to A8xx of spades spots (in other match)|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps East should have just bid 4@H and not given N-S time to find their club fit|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|kit: East will never know how well the hands fit anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 5@C is pass or correct, I'm sure.  Quite an aggressive bid, but works very well|pg||
nt|kit: West apparently thinks he is in a force, as otherwise the double doesn't make much sense|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5@H would be a good spot EW|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, and East might have bid it if West hadn't doubled.  Now I can't see him doing so.|pg||
nt|jkdood: 5@C by South, undoubled, is where the other room has stopped|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|nt|kit: wow -- that was quite a decision|pg||
