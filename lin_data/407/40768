nt|SFoxa:  and after S showed spades (via transfer) N has overbidden 3NT from W by 4@s|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|game over: West has to evaluate now whether he has good clubs (then 3NT) or bad clubs, then 4@c or perhaps 4@d (showing two-places)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|game over: South trusts the opponents, not his partner (a double is certainly an option as he has at least one club trick and likely one spade-trick and perhaps a diamond trikc)|pg||

nt|game over: then declarer could have ruffed the fourth heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|game over: (for one down)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|game over: I guess E/W play Polis club, 1@c = 12-14 balanced (w/o five-card major), 15+clubs or 18+any, but unfortunately I don't know the details|pg||
nt|game over: 1@h nat (can be three-cards), 1@s = NAT, 2@d = GF_relay (guess)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|game over: if they play Polish club East cannot have a game-forcing hand with 3hearts anymore as he would have bid 2@d over 1@h, so he has an absolute maximum now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|game over: play in six hearts will be interesting, perhaps South will get subject to a late squeeze (after declarer tried a diamond to the king at some point)|pg||
nt|game over: a kiebitzer suggests (thank you!) 4@c now to complete the picture (which certainly shows the distribution but perhaps not the strength)|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|game over: I think East considers taking the control of the auction (key-card and blast slam) but then he might miss 7|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|game over: East bid 3@h to continue a cooperative bidding and after no slam-interest by West decided he has enough for slam|pg||
nt|game over: if clubs break, declarer has little problems|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  or if N starts with @dA for some reason|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|game over: I think he will take this trick, play a diamond, if the defense returns a heart, he could play two rounds of clubs and then finesse in spades?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  looks good from our seats :)|pg||
nt|game over: the advantage of not asking for aces - North does not want to give the heart position away (if declarer has good diamonds and @h Kxxxx)|pg||
nt|game over: certainly easier to spot this line if you can see all four hands|pg||
pc|c3|nt|game over: yes, since the defense did not return a heart he can now take eight heart tricks and @s AK|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|d5|pg||

nt|game over: when you ruff the fourth spade|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  @s  finess as a rescue?|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  unfortunately, doesn't work|pg||
nt|game over: spade finesse is not possible anymore as North can overruf the fourth spade or the fith club|pg||
