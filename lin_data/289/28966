nt|vankan:  Marion is looking at a lot of possible alternatives.|pg||

nt|petergill: increased|pg||

nt|vankan:  That is a very good point. |pg||

nt|petergill: in which case she has to worry about "2 spade ruffs" possibility ... not happening today|pg||
nt|vankan:  In that case she must play @d first to cut communications|pg||
nt|petergill: No weak two opening suggests 5-2 spades, but at this vulnerability, a weak 2@S opening should be very sound|pg||
nt|vankan:  But that also has its problems|pg||
nt|petergill: If you cash @HA first, you might lose out in the timing, so perhaps play a @d now?|pg||
