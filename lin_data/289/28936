mb|1N|nt|petergill: the wrongsiding of this hand was that it made the @D switch easier to find, looking at the different dummies|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: A perfectly normal 3NT here. It is also normal to go down on a club lead|pg||

nt|petergill: Me wrong? 4@S!|pg||
mb|p|nt|tokay1975: this  bid is  for magazine:)|pg||

nt|petergill: Perhaps 2@S was not discussed? I like to play it as invitational with 4 spades|pg||
