mb|d|nt|BroLucius:  South will be worried about weak trumps and general lack of point-count for his 3@S.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  West doubles the cue-bid to request a club lead (to start a forcing defence).|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Of course many pairs would miss this slam in a club game. Not so many in this event, but still a few.|pg||
