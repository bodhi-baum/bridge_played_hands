mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe you don't want to splinter with only three-card support?|pg||
nt|bt:	north has a huge hand now, marked heart shortness in south|pg||
mb|r|nt|bt:  yes, but isnt it tempting to describe your hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Yes, but I like the fourth diamond opposite 5+|pg||
nt|bt:	can south have less than this, or AK in clbs and @DA?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wow  slam in the other room|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In another match, Tor Helness was doubled in 6@D, and made of course|pg||
nt|bt:	my mother would make 6@D|pg||
nt|bt:	i beg the specs to look at the club spots|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have even been in worse grand slams. Certainly several American pairs have, when they bid 7@D off @DA|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|bt:  i think a slow 5@D is  bad bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How slow was it?|pg||
nt|bt:	a bad bid, north will be handcuffed to pass|pg||
nt|bt:	it seemed slow here, i dont know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Helen should bid 4@S|pg||
nt|pelu:  also it could be 4Â½@D and 5Â½@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: it was slow...|pg||

mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|bt:  2@D is not timid by any means|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Can't East bid 4@S en route?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That must imply a diamond fit|pg||
nt|bt:	well, sometimes raising our partner is an option|pg||
nt|pelu:  but over the Rd I would have bid 2@s|pg||
