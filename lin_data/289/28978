mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  2@D, to show a sound club raise, also has the advantage that West can rebid a major if she holds one.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  The jump must be intended as a splinter bid with clubs agreed.|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|BroLucius:  A reasonable slam, after the opening bid by South - albeit in 3rd seat.|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Boye has bid fearlessly on his moderate values. Even he must now limit them.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Even more bravery still required!|pg||
nt|Rodal F: E can't que 4@H with no other que so might 6@C to come|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  West is facing a passed hand. It would be a wonderful effort to reach 6@C.|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Here hand have grown with the @D opening at S|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Even if West is certain, from the opening bid, that the @DA is onside, she still has to deal with the other diamonds.|pg||
nt|jr7:  Can she be sure 4@H is the A|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  4@H must be the ace if her @H3 was a splinter.|pg||
nt|Rodal F: Often not, but would the passed hand que then?|pg||
nt|Rodal F: As well|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|BroLucius:	In 5@D declarer must attempt to duck a round of hearts to East (the safe hand). He can do this if West follows with the @H10 on the second round.|pg||
