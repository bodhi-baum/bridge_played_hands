nt|bebechira: Hinden http://livebridge.net/bbo/wbf/player.php?wbf=12018|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|toukie:  Looks like they probably play 15-17|pg||
nt|paulg:  perhaps 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|paulg:  Osborne facing a typical decision ... do you just show interest in spades or show both your suits and imply a lack of suitability for no-trump|pg||
nt|toukie:  We can see 5C makes but 3N will fail on a diamond lead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  some partnerships can also show a weak doubleton, although this is used more on balanced hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzew: can't hear explanations|pg||
nt|paulg:  I suspect Osborne has shown clubs and spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  and Hinden has selected 3NT due to her soft values|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@D = multi |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Myers has gambled by passing|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is a weak "trash" multi, i think they play 2@h as more constructive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South as a problem holding both majors|pg||
nt|paulg:  their multi does not have a strong option, so he is trying to make it more difficult for them|pg||
nt|paulg:  most people defend here as if East has opened a weak 2@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  so Osborne can & probably should double|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Hinden will bid 4@S surely|pg||
nt|Clinch: You have to think so|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Clinch: Hmm|pg||
nt|paulg:  they are playing with screens, so unclear whether East or South paused|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Even with screens I think you can work out who pauses|pg||
