nt|HedyG: yes probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north may be able to open 2@D systemically in third seat; of course he may prefer 1nt, or pass, anyway :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|HedyG: 1NT = 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|HedyG: slight upgrade, but certainly worth it|pg||
mb|p|nt|HedyG: cannot open 2@d with a balanced hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: 2@D promises an unbalanced hand in first and second seat, sure, but they have more leeway in third|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: @C9 lead in the other room convinced declarer that the @CK was over the queen|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||

nt|athene: 1NT is notoriously difficult to defend; even if declarer (as here) slips up, the defence more often than not will return the favour|pg||
nt|HedyG: the webpage for the event: http://www.federbridge.it/campionati/2014/CXSQLBSG/indice.asp|pg||
nt|athene: now east gets endplayed so he never makes his @CK|pg||
nt|HedyG: throw in with a @H?|pg||
nt|athene: he just gets @SA @DA @H7|pg||
nt|athene: well he has a lot of bare aces to be thrown in with :)|pg||
nt|HedyG: we know that but Fantoni doesnt|pg||
nt|athene: no, it's hard to read the cards - fantoni might expect east to double a weak notrump with as many HCP as he has|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not sure it really matters |pg||
nt|athene: declarer has lost 3 tricks already|pg||
nt|athene: so he knows he can't just play a club towards the queen because that would surely give the defence at least @SA @DA @h7 and @CK more|pg||
nt|HedyG: and he has no entry to dummy anymore anyhow|pg||
nt|HedyG: so play 6@H and disc a @d|pg||
nt|HedyG: cannot disc anything else|pg||
pc|h6|pc|cJ|nt|athene: but now you never get a spade OR a diamond trick|pg||

nt|athene: yes, knock out north's entry to hand so he can't get the spade or diamond|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@S is decent here if not exactly laydown|pg||

mb|3N|nt|HedyG: could 3@c be a xfer?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: my guess would be 3@C shows the overall strength of the hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|HedyG: and serious 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: some play 1@S - 2NT; 3@c shows a few extras and 3@D is a dead minimum, but there are lots of different schemes|pg||
nt|HedyG: many play 3@c showing minimum|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|HedyG: but i would have thought 3@d would be relay then|pg||
nt|HedyG: the 3@s confuses me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  3@S may show limited strength|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: not at all obvious what is the best line here|pg||
nt|athene: do you start @DK, @DA, small diamond?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  difficult to make this with 4-1 spades and 4-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: if north then follows you have to decide whether to ruff high|pg||
nt|queequeg: Live streaming of this event: http://bridgeditalia.it/diretta/|pg||
nt|athene: and even if that passes off ok, you might then be setting yourself up for a diamond ruff/overruff when you later lose to the @SA|pg||

nt|athene: now he is short of entries to hand to draw trumps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he should have considered ruffing the diamond high and finessing the @S7|pg||
nt|athene: pay off to north being brilliant with @S108 doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: he can still make but only by getting cute|pg||
nt|nilsland:  needs to score both trumps now to make it|pg||
nt|athene: he basically has to abandon the idea of drawing trumps and using the diamonds, and just scramble tricks making both trumps en passent with heart ruffs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|c7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not so bad, he has all the top tricks, just needs south to follow to the @CAK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 1-suit opening bids for NS are "usually" 14+ hcp but they can be lighter with both majors, as here|pg||
mb|p|nt|HedyG: so 1anything is 14+ except with 5-4 majors can be a lot weaker|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|djneill:  on a spade lead, it's more likely North has the @sJ than South|pg||

pc|s5|nt|djneill:  Garbosi keeps some clubs to maintain a little mystery about that suit for now|pg||

pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||

nt|HedyG: 2NT with QJx in @H?|pg||
nt|athene: if so, then i guess south can work out the @H6 can't be a small doubleton|pg||

nt|HedyG: 1@D = 14+ natural or 15+ balanced , forcing 1 round|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|HedyG: so this is the 15+ balanced |pg||
nt|athene: well, 6@S has a lot more chance played by south, with the clubs protected|pg||
nt|HedyG: 2@c relay|pg||
nt|athene: you can safety-play the spades - you might even make it?|pg||
nt|athene: with the diamond finesse working|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: not that they are going to bid 6@S, i am sure|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|djneill:  it is Italian style to open 1 of a suit even with 21-22, and then use gadgets to slowly force and force and force again|pg||
mb|2N|nt|djneill:  so 2@c is a true monster|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  2NT is gadget |pg||
