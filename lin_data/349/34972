nt|Harlan: 5+@Cs  sorry|pg||
nt|Harlan: typo|pg||
nt|Harlan: 2NT was probably an alert|pg||
nt|Harlan: asking more about shape|pg||
nt|lebridgeur: Not a bad 5 @d  but fails as the @d finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Kit, does 4@s make?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|kit: 5@D is the best game, and against that, defense needs to cash.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|TopWizard:  Ah, no sorry|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S can be beaten with diamond shift|pg||
nt|kareno: spade, two hearts and that's all I see|pg||

pc|s2|nt|kit: now can make|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Now makiing with @s duck|pg||
nt|kit: no -- will go up and go for quick pitch I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Well not on that lead.  Does Coudert think west is 3-1-4-5?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: If he reads spade position, then third round of spades is best|pg||

nt|kit: with clubs 3-3, playing on clubs works fine|pg||
nt|kit: if he plays a spade, he might go down|pg||
nt|kareno: No, one pitch and then diamond finesse works also|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  So has to guess which black suit is 3-3?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|d3|nt|kit: defense takes 2 hearts, puts diamond through, and he has to guess which to play for|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|kit: down at least 1 -- more if declarer loses control|pg||

nt|kareno: Nothing about cooperative or penalty that I heard.|pg||
nt|Harlan: maybe "frustration" of the penalty X being pulled promoted East to bid 3@d on his 3343 medium hand|pg||
nt|Harlan: but these two are veterans   so that should not happen|pg||
nt|kit: maybe he thought 2@D was forcing -- remember, West did start with redouble|pg||

mb|4S|nt|le joker:  Si Sud dit XX, cela s'annonce catastrophique pour la France|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|jkdood: And sure enough game/slam nbr 8 of the current roll...|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other room broke that streak; they are stopped in 2@H NS in this hand|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jkdood: The @C shift makes communications a real  worry now|pg||
nt|rossoneri: no one else playing in a @S contract at any level, much less 4@S|pg||
nt|jkdood: I think East made an excellent play not all would find at this juncture|pg||
nt|rossoneri: 2@H and 3NT being very common contracts in the field|pg||
nt|jkdood: Hard to see any path to 10 tricks after the @C shift|pg||
