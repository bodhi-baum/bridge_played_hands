nt|bjacobs:  You can't really draw trumps without trumping that third spade|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the card on the website may be differen tto the one at the table - was 2@s = @s + m?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  You can't worry about 4-1 trump breaks.  This is a contract that can't stand anything bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: no, 2@s = weak one suited, may be frequent 5cards|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  N/S are not on solid ground.  Who would be, after this bizarre auction?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I thought it was "pick a contract", but maybe not, because 4NT is a contract, and he hasn't passed it yet|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the @s suit appears lost forever now|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this board has not been flat in any of the 5 matches which have compared it so far|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  kibs saying 4NT can make, but I think it's 2 down on a club lead|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  N bids "standard" with 2@s not necessarily showing a suit|pg||
mb|3D|an| |mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Harlan: I am guessing 2@C was also an alert and 2@D limited South's hand|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  With strong hands, bidding your 5-card minor before a 4-card Major is best|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Many top players now play 2@c is either balanced or @c's|pg||
nt|Harlan: but if it were standard 2/1	Gary is absolutely right.  Create the Game Force 1st!|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  The N-S Convention Card is full of fine print :)|pg||
nt|Harlan: South has aces and a king which are more valuable then just 11 HCP|pg||
nt|Harlan: add in the JT of hearts 5th	 and this not an automatic pass by south|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  3 small @c's is a negative|pg||
nt|Harlan: Wel, that depends on what the alert of 2@S was.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  If accepting, most answer Aces to the quantitative 4NT|pg||
nt|Harlan: if it promised more @C then @s w/4+@s  3 small clubs is not that bad|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  S may fear a singleton @h in dummy on the auction?|pg||
nt|Harlan: I am tending to believe 3@D was a cue/slam try in @cs.  South declined.  Now North is trying again so South is reconsidering|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Juniors are quite fast overall, so plenty of time to think when it matters|pg||
nt|Harlan: but we are "guess" without an explanation from the operator	[Understand the operators have a very difficult or impossible time seeing player's hand written notes]|pg||

mb|5S|nt|thenapster: Inv +|pg||
nt|thenapster: robenshol we call it :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  6@d is a profitable save|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and could be really profitable if NS take the push to 6@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  One popular scheme after the Unusual 2NT is: 3@C: @H inv+, 3@D: @S inv+, 3@H/@S: nat non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  That scheme works equally whether 1@H or 1@S opened|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  It's just so tempting to leave the opps at the 5-level.	But here it happens to be the right spot|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The thing is, even 7@D is a profitable (phantom sacrifice)|pg||
nt|thenapster: good bidding by both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  If you're going to risk 6@D with West's hand, you have to be prepared for dealing with their slam bid|pg||
nt|thenapster: I agree|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I don't know about you, but my inclination in these situations is, if I'm going to bid over their 5 bid, I'm going to bid over their 6 bid.  Even if it turns into a phantom.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2N|nt|TopWizard:	It would seem that Declarer misplayed, no way to 12 tricks using @h's on Board 7|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Adam G. has his bid this time, probably could be much lighter|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Many play that S bids 3@d to show limit or better in @s's|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|Harlan: sometimes it takes courage more then technique to make the correct/needed play.  Fear stops some people|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Harlan: referring to BD 7 in the other room|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Indeed, well stated, Harlan|pg||
nt|Harlan: I am sure 3@D is "unusual over unusual" here    showing @ss|pg||

nt|Harlan: not as much as*|pg||
mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  This is bridge at a very high level, nobody will sell out or be intimidated|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|TopWizard:  Should Adam G. have bid more after partner's 5@h, Harlan?|pg||
nt|Harlan: well E-W missed a good sac as 5@s makes losing only 1@D and 1@h from the gallery|pg||

nt|Harlan: loser|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|TopWizard:  Now a @h overruff coming|pg||
nt|Harlan: so you can expect to make only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Nice analysis, Harlan|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Adam probably should have led trumps?  N was able correctly to discard a @h and now has to make a second trump trick for N-S|pg||
nt|Harlan: one more point:  West showed black cards.  it is not clear he has a @D fit.	You have a singleton.  Partner might have 4@ds|pg||

mb|1H!|an|4+!s|nt|TopWizard:  Howard and Ginnan played very effectively for Australia at the other table|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|mrdct:  yes they a good a set apart from the misadventure in 6@s on brd 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Harlan: 1@h is a "Transfer Advance" to show @ss|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  might propel EW to 4@s whcih i think will fail|pg||

nt|vugraphzbj: S explained as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: N didn't alert anything|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: so W claims he is not gonna bid 3@s|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  But N-S would bid 3@d and possibly go plus there?|pg||
nt|Harlan: no even 3@D is down|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: N wasn't asked, so director said E could easily asked about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzbj: director left, the decision will be taken afterwards|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Harlan: yes.  But East has all those heart values|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  3@h was probably a fit-showing jump, Harlan?|pg||
nt|Harlan: let them bid NT and X (or lead yourself) for @s|pg||
nt|Harlan: I am guessing|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  USA1 picks up a slam swing on Board 11 in 6@h|pg||
nt|Harlan: but if it was, it doesn't promise 6@hs, and usually has 4@ds|pg||
