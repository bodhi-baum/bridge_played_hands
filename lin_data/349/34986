mb|p|nt|ntmon: 2@D is waiting, basically @D or balanced hand < 18 HCP|pg||
mb|2N|nt|shengabus:  I think the next is coming up in 30 min (the juniors)|pg||

nt|ntmon: thanks our operator in Istanbul, thanks to Yuan for his comments and all kibs with their contributions |pg||
pc|d5|nt|shengabus:  An aggressive lead from a king here, but partner may be short|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Declarer has announced a flat hand type, but West might have some shape.|pg||
