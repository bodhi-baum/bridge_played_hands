mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|lady007:  NS have 25 HCP and as my junior coach used to say "3NT with 25 HCP cannot be a bad game" |pg||
nt|lady007:  but in this case it is not so clear where the 9th trick should come from|pg||
nt|lady007:  even the spades 3-3 will only mean the 8th trick|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lady007:  there are some possibilities in the club suit, and luckily for declarer east will not have any hearts to play back|pg||
nt|lady007:  note that west ducked the king of spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  in a 3NT contract declarer is unlikely to just play to his Kx in trick two|pg||
nt|lady007:  so it is quite safe to duck this|pg||
nt|lady007:  maybe it will make communications harder for him because he will try to play another spade from the dummy, or give declarer a guess if he has KQx|pg||
nt|lady007:  if declarer gets the club lay out right he can get another trick in that suit|pg||
nt|lady007:  even anohter 2 tricks|pg||

nt|lady007:  http://www.worldbridge.org/repository/tourn/Istanbul.14/microsite/Results.htm for results and running scores|pg||
nt|lady007:  west knows it wont help him to set up the hearts as he doesnt have enough entries|pg||
nt|lady007:  he was hoping declarer would play another suit so that his partner could win and hopefully return another heart|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|lady007:  but declarer wants to postpone the decision on how to play clubs|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|lady007:  and now he cannot lose 4 tricks directly by playing spades, even if they are 42 (only risk is spades 5-1 but maybe east would have bid 1@s then)|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lady007:  3@h would show @s and 3@s would show @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  because you want the 1N opening to declarer|pg||
nt|lady007:  on this hand it doesnt matter but he could have had Kx of clubs|pg||
nt|lady007:  and in general it is often better if the strong hand declares, so the opponents dont know where all the HCP are|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  but it seems that N thinks that 3@d shows diamonds|pg||
