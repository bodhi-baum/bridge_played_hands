pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  At the other table, 7@C was led, which was hardly a great lead.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|bjacobs:  If it loses to the jack, you finesse on the way back, again making 3 times out of 4|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  this is a play that puts East under a lot of pressure should he hold @HKx|pg||
nt|kareno: That's another version of one out of two finesses.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|TopWizard:  Bill, in that case, would you suggest the @hA first from dummy to avoid a guess when E plays low (you then pick up any doubleton honor in East)?|pg||
