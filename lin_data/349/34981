mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  6@d needs the diamonds 3-2 or stiff jack. then it needs no club loser, so clubs 3-3 or 4-2 with Qx or Jx in west (you can play AK of clubs and then small to the ten)|pg||

nt|lady007:  maybe 4@d would have been better here? this sounds more like club support to me|pg||
nt|lady007:  and you know south is unlikely to have a spade cue (unless singleton) so 4@h kind of "endplays him in the bidding" |pg||
nt|lady007:  this means that south has no convenient bid over 4@h|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lady007:	south is reasoning that north should have a spade cuebid for his bidding anyway|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  yes it seems that south thinks that clubs is trumps|pg||

nt|bobholl: vulnarable west surely has 6@S so :(|pg||

nt|lady007:  the French now had 2 bad boards in a row, with some decisions that were maybe doubtfull but that could have been taken by anyone of us. now it is important to not despair, but keep your concentration on a high level|pg||

nt|lady007:  imo that is a very bad habit|pg||
nt|lady007:  of course it works sometime but the reason its an ususual thing is often because its not the recommended thing. so you can easily get 2 bad boards in a row|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  and then if you try to get that back again.... etc|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lady007:  1@d is either 0-7 HCP or natural (or some other hands)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  1@h is usually 13-16 NT (they play 10-12 NT here) or unbalanced @h+@c|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lady007:  1@s was asking which one|pg||
nt|lady007:  and 1N confirmed the 13-16 balanced|pg||
nt|lady007:  so 1@h could have been any 12-14 balanced, so north does not know that west has 4@h|pg||
