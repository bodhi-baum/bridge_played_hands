nt|adriaantje: the French girls are ranked 1st and the Dutch 3rd so this is quite a top level match|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  godefroy, is this the same french team that won the europeans last year?|pg||
nt|poussin:  almost, there was only one change|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|lady007:	EW have been playing in the French girls teams for a long time. I think I even played against them in the girls in 2004 or 2005!|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  NS got to 3N, which is not even sure to make, whereas 6@c is almost lay down|pg||
nt|adriaantje: a @D lead is best on this layout but not very attractive (although it is the unbid suit)|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes but you have no other good lead either|pg||
nt|lady007:  the french style is more solid than the dutch, this is why west didnt overcall 1@d|pg||
nt|adriaantje: true|pg||
nt|lady007:  i think north should have bid a bit more|pg||
nt|adriaantje: she takes her time for the lead though|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lady007:  maybe she thinks that the "slow route" (3N thru 4th suit as opposed to a direct 3N) shows extra's|pg||
nt|lady007:  but i think this is a widely spread misunderstanding|pg||
nt|lady007:  because she might have been asking if her partner had 3crd heart support|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lady007:  with partner being 64 or 54 in spades and clubs she has a great hand, 4crd support and 3 aces as well as ruffing values in spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|poussin:  although she has a very strong hand in a clibs contract with 3 aces and 4 trumps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s2|nt|adriaantje: I think NS have probably played together much less than most pairs participating so their agreements might be less strong (although this is a sort of standard situation)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lady007:  i think she could have tried 4@c. her partner has a minimum hand now (although very nice controls) but i suppose she could have had the king of clubs instead of the queen as well, and maybe even AKxxxx|pg||

pc|d6|mc|8|nt|lady007:	at the other table south bid 2@h over the 2@d 4th suit, and north got to show club support with 3@c|pg||
nt|poussin:  the point is that she can investigate slam as 5@c is likely to make anyway|pg||
nt|lady007:  but there they also ended in 3N|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes very good point|pg||
nt|adriaantje: well, if she bids 4@C and her partner signs off in 4NT, she would have to correct to 5@C|pg||
nt|lady007:  the french pair probably leads 4th best|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: *the @d goes on the 3rd @h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if 3@c show slam interest in @c, then i don't understand 3@d|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i think you should bid what you have, like 3@s (good @s) or 4@c (good hand for @c slam too)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: could South be 4333 in their methods after 2@h?|pg||
nt|Authau: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or 4234|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: those hands i would bid 3@d now, if i don't have a @d stopper|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but she has a good 5-card @c suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: North might be worried about the @c suit now|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lady007:	but that is very double dummy and overtricks really matter on these relatively short matches|pg||
nt|poussin:  well if she leads the deuce from 3 she might lead it from 5 too|pg||

nt|lady007:  if south only has 2 clubs, it is better to just try to set up the club suit|pg||
nt|lady007:  north probably thinks west is a bit stronger|pg||

nt|poussin:  declarer had 6 top tricks, the Queen of spades as a 7th|pg||
nt|lady007:  but west knows she has to duck a spade trick at some point as has the clubs well stopped so she just ducks a spade|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes, even if she sets up the spades, she only has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|poussin:  but then there is squeeze possibility|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch	 needed|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes but the squeeze might not work as long as north keeps all her diamonds. These are important to prevent an endplay|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lady007:  will east bid 4@s? she has a nice diamond card and usefull spot cards in spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  but west will overrule that|pg||
nt|lady007:  ok|pg||
nt|adriaantje: what should north lead?|pg||
nt|lady007:  she will probably lead a diamond or a club|pg||
nt|poussin:  I would lead a club, and then south has to switch to Ace of @d and @d to take a ruff|pg||
nt|lady007:  a trump could also be an option but the 3N bid sounds like 4333 so no ruffing values expected thee|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D and @H switch but they won't find that|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead beats it	with a ruff |pg||
nt|bobholl: also ruff possible yes|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes, or play a heart back after winning the ace of clubs because declarer has no entry|pg||
nt|adriaantje: @D lead can be down 2|pg||
nt|ady: or   a heart return|pg||
pc|c7|nt|adriaantje: @C lead down 1|pg||
nt|lady007:  i think she will rather do that as a diamond from Ax is very much speculating on partner having the ace of spades and might blow up the entire diamond suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|poussin:  right|pg||
nt|bobholl: but is taking the ace now obvious ?|pg||
nt|adriaantje: that's the question|pg||
nt|lady007:  ace might be wrong if partner has 2 small|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lady007:  but even then declarer might not have direct discards because partner ccan ruff the 3rd club|pg||
nt|bobholl: well done (as usual) by ticha|pg||
nt|lady007:  this is why many pairs nowadays play count leads instead of attitude|pg||
nt|adriaantje: or count leads versus suit contracts and attitude leads versus no trump contracts|pg||
nt|adriaantje: also increasingly favoured|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: now a diamond for down 2|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @D and 2 down possible|pg||
nt|lady007:  declarer decided to play for the king of hearts onside. this is of course quite possible because south could also play a heart away from the king as she sees those will be discarded on the clubs anyway. and maybe partner has the ace|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lady007:  she could also play the ace and hope to sneek a spade to the jack. but i think that is too obvious and you give up on quite a decent chance that the king is onside|pg||

nt|lady007:  this is because her 3 aces is exactly what she has|pg||

nt|bobholl: other room in 7 :(|pg||
nt|lady007:  while if she asks for keycards herself, she has no idea what her partner has so she canot judge what the final contract should be|pg||
nt|poussin:  but 3@h should have set trump|pg||
nt|lady007:  it is always important to think about this before bidding blackwoord: what will i bid over partners responses?|pg||
nt|poussin:  the problem is that East never get to give a clear heart fit|pg||
nt|lady007:  if you have no idea; is there a way that partner can bid blackwood? maybe he/she is in a better position to judge this|pg||
