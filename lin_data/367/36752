nt|ahollan1: Nickell had lost lead to Schwartz for one round  then regained it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but  Schwartz already 1.5-.5 for this set   and the spread between the 2 teams less than a push|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leader board gets manually updated at   www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how much longer we'll get updates   historically director stops handing out results and may stop comparisons with teammates  with 2 or 3 rounds remaining|pg||
