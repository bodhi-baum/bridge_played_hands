nt|Vugraphzfd: The finals of the 3-day National Swiss are also taking place now, some three floors below us.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|kareno: Have you got a midday result?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I ran down during the break to take a look at the leaderboard, and Carolyn Lynch's squad was running away from the field with 3 matches to play.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: acbl never posts live scores   but   new leaderboard gets posted to www.usbf.org	 unfortunately now only thru board 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Stansby PASS over 2@H denies 3+@S|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|bobholl: ns have to play @C in time to get the magic +200|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: For New Englanders, exciting to see Grossack brothers doing very well too (standing fourth in that event).|pg||
nt|kareno: In principle the defense has six tricks but the race will be to see if they get their two clubs established before declarer sets up his spade jack.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: The scoring, as most already know, is Board-A-Match ("BAM").|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: BAM is like a team version of matchpoints: for each board, you either win (1 MP), lose (0 MPs), or draw (0.5 MPs) compared to your teammates.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: There are decimals in the score totals because of the carryover from the last two days, as well as some slow play penalties.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|kareno: I'll guess that n/s will end up in 3nt here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Rumor had it that the directors were liberal with the slow play penalties yesterday.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: From their perspective, it is a constant struggle to get the players to finish on time.|pg||
nt|kareno: So that they can get out to their dinners on time :)+|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Surely that is part of the reason ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: I'll be interested to see if that continues.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: But also, it is really a different game if there are no (enforced) time limits.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfd: And if there are limits, it is not fair to those who are trying to meet them that others feel no such pressures.|pg||
nt|kareno: That's true.  However, I don't see WBF enforcing those rules so it is not a level playing field|pg||
