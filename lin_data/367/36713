pc|hT|nt|Vugraphzfd: Weinstein asks about their defensive carding, standard, mostly suit preference to declarer's lead.|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfd: Weinstein takes a minute, tells defenders he is just thinking about the hand.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Chick: he has a big club problem ... if he tries to set to ruff them, defense will get some ruffs themselves|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Team Nickell coach Eric Kokish again stepping in as dummy.|pg||
nt|medwards: But the ten and seven smash out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin taking a little walk around the room, getting some water, staying loose.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Willenken thinking this over, fingering his cards, head in hand.|pg||
nt|medwards: Timing is importaant for both defense and declarer on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin standing nearby, trying not to watch.|pg||
