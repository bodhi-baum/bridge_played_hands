mb|p|nt|Schafer:  So EW stop|pg||
nt|Schafer:  But it tells NS to lead @Cs|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Explanations on both sides of the screen.  They do not have special agreements about the later rounds of this auction.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Schafer:  4@D showed a @D control with no @C control I think, so East signed off|pg||
nt|Schafer:  And Steve was listening|pg||
nt|Schafer:  And made a good lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Schafer:  If two players (on opposite sides) that don't have a lot to think about can speed things up by letting someone know it won't matter unless.....|pg||
