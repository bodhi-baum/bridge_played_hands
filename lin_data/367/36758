pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin pulls his card toward himself as dummy, looking it over.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Two of Levin and Weinstein's kibitzers have switched places, perhaps thinking that their previous arrangement was bad luck.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: And now young French expert Cedric Lorenzini has joined to kibitz as well, looking over Levin's shoulder.|pg||

nt|Schafer:  It looks like SCHWARTZ is going to lose Brd  21.  If Nickell can win 21, it will be just over a 1/2 point lead for SCHWARTZ.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Looks like Nickell wins 21 and Schwartz loses it, so it should be just over a 1/2 point difference with 2 rounds to go.|pg||
