mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfd: Weinstein asks about 3@S, and Dubinin says: "Not great."|pg||
nt|kareno: Very modern preempt be east.|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|Vugraphzfd: Perhaps a slight understatement...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Drewsky: I wonder if he would open 3@S playing rubber bridge for big money :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Wonder if he even plays rubber bridge, Drew :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Drewsky: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: They are playing with screens here, and the darned cards keep falling off.	Some confusion about what has actually been bid.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: (They slide trays containing the bids under a screen that has some felt hanging from it, and the felt keeps knocking the bids off...)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|kareno: Constant spade leads should do in 5@h. |pg||

nt|kareno: Would the cards sit better if they used only one card per bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Definitely.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: It's pretty funny to watch though.  "Is that what you bid?" has been asked a number of times already...|pg||
