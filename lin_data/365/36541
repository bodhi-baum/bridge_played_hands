nt|psridhar:  almost divided strength but EW have a 9 card fit while NS dont |pg||
nt|psridhar:  EW shd buy this in 3@c though i dont rule out 3@D by NS over that in competition|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: boads dished out to  top 16  tables were   25-30   no  corrected  ands bottom field was playing	19-24|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|psridhar:  but 1@c-p-1@d shd scupper that competition|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  RV can still try 2@d over 2@c|pg||
mb|d|nt|psridhar:  X is unattractive in view of 3 @s only|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|psridhar:  this X shd show @D and @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:	a card short in @s for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar:  another problem with X is it locates @c Q for decl in 3@c|pg||
nt|psridhar:  i pref 2@d instead of X|pg||
nt|psridhar:  NV vs Vul cant be too bad|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psridhar:  pd knows i didnt bid 2@d over 1@d directly|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|psridhar:  so a late 2@d is weaker|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|psridhar:  this 3@c shd make in comfort|pg||
nt|psridhar:  may be with an OT even|pg||
nt|psridhar:  2 more @s to def from here|pg||
nt|psridhar:  and max another trick in the 'wash'|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|psridhar:  decl needs to ruff 2@h AND pick up trumps for OT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  depends what rebid rv chooses after 1@c-1@H-?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  if he bids 3@c Arvind will try 3N may be|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  ok a conservative 2@c it is |pg||
nt|psridhar:  ensures they dont go overbd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:	i wont fault 3@c -running @c -only lacks aces for that , if pd tries 3N he may be disappointed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psridhar:  @hK,@dQ are more like fillers / stoppers not fast tricks in 3N|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psridhar:  in fact he may be held to 8 tricks only|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|psridhar:  so 2@c is a winner -as cards lie|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psridhar:  half the field playing precn here -cant see all N passing a 2@c opg with 5-4 majors|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|psridhar:  W has a promising hand but if E opens a weak 2@d...|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar:  his dreams will end|pg||
mb|2H|an|F1|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  with such weak spots that 3@d is ugly|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  yes Sadhu is a fighter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:	that 3@H shd be NF|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D!|an|STR Bal Raise|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  18 opp 10 , slam hinging on @c hook and fair breaks all round, i dont expect 6@s to be popular across the field|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psridhar:  3@D is a strong raise of @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  those cue bids -i daresay somewhat made mechanically -might spur them to a lucky slam|pg||
nt|psridhar:  3@D is more often than not 18-19 bal|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  with E hand place them across suits u will find slam is not gr8|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6S|nt|psridhar:  from E 's perspective what does he need for slam?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  AQXX,XXX,AKX,AQX will do nicely|pg||
nt|psridhar:  but what if opener held say a wasted @HK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|psridhar:	or a Q even instead of @c Q? u will be off @hA and a @c trick|pg||

nt|psridhar:  i wd say -over 3@d E was worth a 'nonserious' 3N-not a generation of successive cue bids|pg||
nt|psridhar:  nonserious 3N = i hv some values that may produce slam opp fitting cards pd|pg||
nt|psridhar:  but i am not very serious about slam|pg||

nt|psridhar:  if your lower honors like Q/J etc are in your long suit they add more value to your trick taking potential|pg||
