nt|psridhar:  4@S X d1 may be the result in many tables -but some will go minus with EW cards competing too high on that attractive shape|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: but  butler  amongst all 49 tables so   it might help  even -1|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  NS can make 5@c givne the lucky lie of @c here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar:  if E had raised his pd's Vul 2@H NS might hv found it tough to locate the @c fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar:  but Jaggy has his own problems here -3@c might show more|pg||

nt|psridhar:  some EW may climb to 4@H-beaten on @s ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|psridhar:  I expect at least 10 NS to reach 5@c|pg||

nt|vugraphzcx: he is still thinking|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|c3|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  at least -500 it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|psridhar:  even -500 vs -650 is 4 imps ; on 6 Bd VP scale it is significant|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|psridhar:  not that i can see a way to do that here on NS cards|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
mc|11|nt|psridhar:  oon Bd 9 there will be a few 4@H making EW way -somewhat unnatural for S to hand a @s ruff to pd|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  another easy / flat 3N for ew here|pg||
mb|1N!|an|Beta|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|3 contros|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  thats a useful convention in def -lead A from AK normally and K from AK if doubleton OR intention to shift to a side stiff|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|psridhar:  one of the upsides of A from AK-if u play K from AK , u cannot comfortably play A as intention to shift to side stiff- as unsupported A is led often|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|psridhar:	on Bd 9 S was looking at @d Q himself, so if his pd led @dK he can be sure it is form AK and hence @s shift is a stiff|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|psridhar:  of course if N didnt lead @d at all..there is no story as no 10 tricks for decl :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|psridhar:  oh he has 11 toppies |pg||

nt|psridhar:  6@c / 6N all make getting there is half the fun |pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|psridhar:  always a tough proposition when one hand holds the shape / source of tricks and the other all HCP|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  3@s shows  long good @c|pg||
nt|psridhar:  towards 3N |pg||
nt|psridhar:  normally 7 carder|pg||
nt|psridhar:  but Jaggy has too many value cards to bid 3N|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  he can expect 7 good @c and an outside A|pg||
nt|psridhar:  as min from pd|pg||
nt|psridhar:  hence a well judged 4@S|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar:  well done|pg||
nt|psridhar:  very well judged|pg||
nt|psridhar:  by Jaggy primarily -also by Swarnendu|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|psridhar:  6N is absolute par for the hand -they shd expect IMPs for this effort|pg||
pc|sA|mc|12|nt|psridhar:  i wd credit them about 8 IMP in the field...and a 12.5-7.5 win lets see|pg||
