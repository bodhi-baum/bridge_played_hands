mb|2N!|nt|Justin C: these are the kind of deals that a leading team likes to see|pg||
nt|paulg:  Morgan will double here to show some values|pg||
nt|Justin C: 2Nt a good @S raise of some description|pg||
mb|d|mb|3S|nt|paulg:  and he'll probably double 3@s for takeout|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:	so South will play in 4@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|Justin C: this 2@C overcall was rather forward|pg||
nt|Justin C: he knows that they need to create some action though|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|paulg:  I don't think they'll be creating action, 18 IMPs is nothing in junior bridge|pg||
nt|paulg:  some may bid 3@c with that hand|pg||
nt|Justin C: I think it is that or pass. 2@C shows values that you don't have here.|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may be wondering whether 3NT should be takeout, but he really wants to play in clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  and perhaps Morgan should bid 4@c rather than double|pg||
nt|Justin C: double leaves open the chance of defending|pg||
nt|paulg:  double is more effective when you have shortage in clubs|pg||
nt|Justin C: seems a reasonable enough choice to me|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|Justin C: whichever minor he bids here, it looks like a heart, two spades and a diamond to lose|pg||
nt|Justin C: assuming he gets the @C right|pg||
nt|paulg:  South, Jun Nakamaru-Pinder, may have been pondering whether 3NT was to play or offering both minors|pg||

mb|d|mb|2C|nt|paulg:  1@c might be short, just 2+ clubs, and 1@H was a transfer showing 4+ spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Justin C: very strange play from declarer I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland bid game on  15 to gain 6 IMPs|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  yes|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|nt|Justin C: the drury convention is where a passed hand uses 2@C to show a maximum passed hand with a fit|pg||

pc|sA|nt|Justin C: it lets you distinguish a serious raise from a weaker one|pg||

mb|2H|nt|Justin C: but i haven't been a junior for a while|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland also made game on  16, to gain a further 12 IMPs|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:	Jun, South, plays with a lot of old men in Aberdeen and Edinburgh|pg||
mb|r|nt|paulg:	who do not encourage 'junior' bidding|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  he might bid 3@h now though|pg||
nt|Justin C: 3@C by West seems more normal than X|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Justin C: I think he was trying to avoid a gf sequence|pg||
nt|paulg:  they open very light, so perhaps concerned that 3@c would effectively be game forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Justin C: but there are players (lots of players) who would think that this 3@D bid is a game try for spades...|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d promises an unbalanced hand so knew he could revert to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|Justin C: evidently Nonnenmach isn't amongst them|pg||
nt|paulg:  i've played against EW quite a lot, they are a solid pair who know what they are doing most of the time|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|paulg:  all four players are very pleasant to play with|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||

nt|paulg:  slightly dangerous lead from East .. if North held two spades and one diamond |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Justin C: he has no particular reason to get the @H right|pg||

nt|paulg:  I believe the current score is 21-9 IMPs to Scotland after six boards. Scotland need to win by 18 IMPs to win the event.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|paulg:  1@d shows 4+ hearts and 1@h shows 12-14 balanced without four hearts|pg||
nt|Justin C: but almost certain to be a flat board - not what Scotland wants|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm not convinced that slam will be bid at both tables|pg||
nt|paulg:  it may be missed at both|pg||
nt|Justin C: Well I don't know the details of the bidding system|pg||
nt|paulg:  you really need to discover that partner has three hearts|pg||
nt|Justin C: but so long as West can show a forcing hand with hearts, East will agree the suit, and West will RKB|pg||
nt|paulg:  and you are missing a key card and the @hQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  partner may only have @hKx|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Justin C: from West's point of view, @HAxx and @DK, @CK or @SQ could be enough|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Justin C: 2@D some form of forcing checkback I guess|pg||
nt|paulg:  i am unsure, it may be a transfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|paulg:	now 5@d asking for the @hQ?|pg||
nt|Justin C: this will come down to whether West knows that East has a third heart|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Justin C: well bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:	luckily a lot easier to play than bid|pg||
