pc|hK|nt|bjacobs:  Well, I don't know about that|pg||

nt|serhat: Sartaj made a big mistake here seeing A9xx H.. why J?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  He's going for 2 diamonds, 3 spades, 2 clubs and 2 hearts.  And it's true that N/S might find it hard to untangle the setting tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|timb: indeed  it has guaranteed 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I'm sorry ... it's a "big mistake" to play @HJ looking at that dummy?  You've got to be joking|pg||
nt|timb: I agree - if you plan to play hearts then a low heart is "right" mostt of the time|pg||
nt|serhat: what advantage do you get Jacobs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well, you don't give away a free trick when West has @HKQx for a start.|pg||
nt|serhat: then it is abviously cold contract|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm not convinced that declarer can get 4 heart tricks if he holds the KQx, given the lack of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: even if South leads a small heart|pg||
nt|timb: This is a "Sam Granat" pause|pg||
pc|c3|nt|timb: Sam was a player in Melbourne,mostly in the 1970s. He would go into an interminable tank as declarer and the only know way out for him was the defenders to offer something "down ...|pg||
nt|timb: two, Sam". To which heinvariably replied "OK" :) |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Thanks Tim.  Now I understand why Google didn't help me!|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Although, there are a couple of Sam Granat's on Facebook!|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I think the real question here is whether North should have played @HQ on the first round ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  He was kind of right and wrong.  It did unblock the suit, but it also weakened it fatally|pg||
nt|timb: It's hard to play @CA here - as an avoidance play it is clear: set up the @D trick when you assume the @CK is wrong. If South has @CK you must finesse.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
