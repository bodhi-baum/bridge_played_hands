mb|5N|nt|Vugraphzfh: All I know is she alerted it|pg||
nt|chip:  If a raise, this would clearly be ace asking, if not, might be natural. Slow response by S suggests unsure, or maybe deciding if she should show the trump Q with 6? Depending on whether 3S already showed 6 and if 2N suggested 4 card support.|pg||
nt|chip:  maybe 4N intended as natural, but seems odd to not support spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: Sorry, of course Levin passed long ago and Bernstein is thinking - I was trying to get Levin & Wheeler to move to a blank note page so I could try to read their notes|pg||
nt|chip:  either 6N or 6S fine. In fact 6N is a better contract as might make even if E had KT9x of spades.|pg||
