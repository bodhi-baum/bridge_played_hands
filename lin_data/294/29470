nt|Vugraphzfb: Chorush just pointed out to Dahl that it was his lead and Dahl said "oh, thank you"|pg||
nt|chip:  I don't like Lall's answer to the question. XX is conventional (it doesn't show a desire to play there).|pg||
nt|chip:  With only 5 boards left to play and 34, Friedland running out of time here.|pg||

nt|chip:  Might bid 2D (or perhaps that should show 4).|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: last set i asked that and it turned out Mark Dahl really had psyched with 2254 3 count|pg||

mb|3C|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C seems a bit flawed too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: P-1@H-2@D-2@H//DBL[@S]-3@C-4@S   makes more sense|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@SX in other room too|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Dahl DBL over 1@H rather than Rubin's	overcall of whichever minor he bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: lead in other room was @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way, declarer seems to be in control with VERY favorable @D layout|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Chorush asks Friedland if he had the @h K, and Friedland says "I do"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2D!|an|sound 3 card raise|nt|swanson:  2@D is a good raise to 2@H.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Chorush sort of yawns and then says "I bet it's been a long whatever for you guys, playing 4-handed"|pg||

nt|chip:  5C by W now or 4. Guess he went low.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  N-S have to save in 5@S here.  West will think he is the one saving when he bids 5@C,|pg||
nt|chip:  N has an easy 4S over 4C, over 5C not so easy.|pg||
nt|pbundy: 5@C is a very good save - the best kind :)|pg||

mc|12|nt|chip:	Lead more important versus 5S (then stiff D much less attractive).|pg||
nt|swanson:  A 3@H call by West over 3@C would have worked well, but is far from obvious.|pg||
nt|chip:  Last board was a push at 690, so Street an easy winner.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Lall apologized to Dahl for the overtrick comment and says that he didn't mean it that way, was just trying to be funny.|pg||
nt|chip:  Bye all. Thanks to our operator.|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye all - see you tomorrow!|pg||
