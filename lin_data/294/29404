pc|sJ|nt|chip:	On a heart lead declarer may play on spades, then find out S is 4-5 in the minors, so short in D, and might misguess the D suit.|pg||
nt|Drewsky: U mean 4-5 in majors, right Chipper ?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|chip:  Also, when S wins the spade might lead a second low heart. That would be right if N had club K (no 10) and D Q.|pg||
nt|chip:  Also, N may throw a D here.|pg||
nt|chip:  Though even then could play for Jxxxx (but perhaps not when it takes this long to pitch).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: no pitching yet... sanborn won second spade and is in tank|pg||
nt|chip:  sorry, I meant on the next spades.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Had S  waited until the 3rd round, she would have seen a signal from N|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chip:	But ducking two spades would be fatal if declarer had Txx of clubs.|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: just explaining why claim took so long ... vugraph operator getting napkins :)|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  (never mind)	:-)|pg||
nt|chip:  I think NS play a pretty standard system with 5 card majors and strong NT. EW play a rather unusual strong C system with lots of relays.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  This delayed raise actually introduced a level of complexity that a direct raise might have avoided.|pg||
nt|chip:  looks like it was taken as a slam try (a bit odd as then would expect a 4m Q-bid).|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:  slight play for 6H if no D lead, but 6N no play without an unlikely error.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  2N was not alerted, so I wonder what she had in mind...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chip:	Well N did have a hand with some slam interest.|pg||
nt|chip:  not sure I agree with the lead, but should help clarify the defense.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  But an unalerted 2N wd tend to slow things down rather than floor the accelerator|pg||
