pc|s4|nt|reisig: Great play|pg||
nt|warrens:  if Hamman plays low, I think East has to win and play a @D, which strikes me as really hard (assuming Hamman can guess the @H position)|pg||
nt|fann4: But declarer is going to have to throw a @D on this trick, so that should help east if he is given the @SQ.|pg||
nt|warrens:  Wold knows almost all of Hamman's points, but since he jumped to 2NT with only 17, he won't know that West has another Queen (instead of at most a Jack if he had 18)|pg||
nt|warrens:  Wold will think declarer has K, Kxx or K10x, AQxxx, AQ10x|pg||

nt|warrens:  still didn't matter|pg||
nt|kareno:  The club was marked.  |pg||
nt|kareno:  But east would end up with three tricks in either case.  so can't make it|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's hoping that the @H ace is disconnected from the @S queen and that the @C will fall (or they'll lead one)|pg||
nt|fann4: Right|pg||
nt|fann4: And the @D 3-3|pg||
nt|warrens:  if West had only 2 @S's to begin with and 3 @C's and the @H Ace, he would make this.  It's a lot of ifs, but at least it's possible.|pg||
