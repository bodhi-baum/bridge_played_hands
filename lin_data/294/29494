nt|dbl me:  Next time someone tries to tell you play is more critical than bidding, show him/her a few hands from these matches...|pg||
nt|chip:  Maybe N should bid 4H over 3S figuring partner likely has 4 cards in a major and sort of have the values for game.|pg||
nt|stevo:  Levin is reasonably having a hard time working out the shape on this hand|pg||
nt|stevo:  yes Chip that would ahve been a big save or maybe even South could try 3H as a passed hand|pg||
nt|dbl me:  S wd love to have had a responsive x available, but over the preempt it's for penalties.|pg||
nt|stevo:  At the other table N/S reached a shaky 5H after north doubled 1D precision and has a crucial spade guess to make her contract|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|sT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chip:	On the prior board, where EW got to 3H in a 5-2, at the other table, EW had a strong club auction to 1N, which was cold.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|dbl me:  For the developing players...overcalling a 4-bagger requires a good suit AND no reasonable alternative.|pg||
nt|stevo:  Nice play by Levin. I think she worked it out from knowing her partner had and odd number of clubs|pg||

nt|dbl me:  Steve, thx for sticking around despite your announcement that you wd be ducking in and out...|pg||
nt|stevo:  Meanwhile this is kinda of annoying hand to play as you are pretty sure its cold unless things go really bad so Wolpert is thinking about all the monsters that might be lurking|pg||
nt|stevo:  Thanks Rich. I put errands on hold(just killed me to be a bum and all!)|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Hey, my major accomplishment since retiring has been seeing 3 Law & Orders consecutively.|pg||
nt|stevo:  I think she is considering ruffing hearts in her hand and ruffing diamonds in dummy both have possible flaws|pg||
nt|stevo:  also she is worried that spades are 4 1 since the jack lead could be a stiff |pg||
nt|stevo:  This is the kind of hand that  sent Larry Cohen into retirement!|pg||
