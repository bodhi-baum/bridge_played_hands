mb|2S|nt|swanson:  7@C could fail with a diamond lead by South.  The auction and restricted choice principles will allow E-W to guess the club suit.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: might also be both minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|swanson:  My idea of an exciting result on this hand would be for East to bid diamonds forthe first time at the seven level, for North to double, hoping to get a club lead, and West remove to 7NT.  Possibly too much to ask for.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: you are correct :)|pg||
nt|swanson:  Rubin would like his hand more if he held two clubs rather than three.  Then there would be the possibility of establishing clubs with a ruff (assuming a diamond contract).|pg||
