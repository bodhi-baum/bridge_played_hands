mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  2NT seems like the normal bid now|pg||

nt|warrens:  with a 6-0 break, this won't work out too well|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|warrens:  Wold must have considered 4@C with his 6-5 hand, but too afraid of the vulnerability|pg||

nt|warrens:  even with 6-0 trumps, 3@S still should make|pg||
nt|warrens:  1@H, 1@C, 3@D and 4@S|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  a good choice to run, but North passing over 3@S would have been the real winner|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|swanson:  In my opinion 3@S was poor (2NT seems clear); double is awful, not running from 3@S seem inferior.  And I wouldn't pull partners double with the South hand. Other than that this was a perfect auction.|pg||
nt|chip:  Not if nobody DBLs. To be fair, if W had a stiff small club, wouldn't look so good to DBL.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chip:	Maybe should lead D A on this auction?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|swanson:  Woolsey might do it for him (kick, that is).|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|nt|chip:  EW didn't get to game in the other room (not that it is cold).|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|warrens:	Part of the challenge for Stewart is that Woolsey likes to overcall all the time, so he didn't have to be that good.  And they had already passed the hand out in a partial, so he didn't realize what they had going.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|swanson:	South passed here, planning to pull a coulbe of partner's 2@C runnout to 2@D.  Bidding 2@D initially would show a little better suit.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|warrens:  assuming a @D lead, you need both to pick up trumps for one loser and a @S finesse to make game, but it works (assuming you don't double finesse in @C's) on this hand|pg||
nt|chip:  Also, P then 2D should suggest some tolerance for hearts.|pg||
nt|chip:  Double finesse in clubs unlikely after T/O DBL by N.|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
nt|warrens:  so, it's really all on the @S finesse, since clubs are very likely to be just one loser|pg||
nt|chip:  Sort of random for EW. Game is decent since W is 2-1 in the reds. If he were 1-2, then no play.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Partnerships have various intrepretations of the stgrength of a immediate bid (like West's 2@C) after partner has redoubled. |pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson:  If it could be weak, seems like West should have bid 5@C rather than 4@C.|pg||
nt|chip:  Given hasn't described shape, W might have just bid game.|pg||
nt|swanson:  IMy default agreement is that pass is always the weakest bid (without specific auction discussion).  THus 2@C is a fair hand.|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|swanson:  I wouldn't be too eager to offer 4@S as a game by East.  Partner is going to have to deal with diamond leads and the spade holding would be shortened quickly.|pg||

nt|swanson:  This will be an easy heart guess for declarer.  That and the successful diamond finesse will provide nine tricks.	This is typical of an agressively bid vulnerable 3NT contract.|pg||
