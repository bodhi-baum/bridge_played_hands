mb|p|nt|3for3:	East thinks his partner has shown majors?|pg||
nt|3for3:  Or blacks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: or spades and a minor :)|pg||
nt|chip:  actually 3S is a serious underbid if partner has blacks.|pg||
nt|3for3:  yes|pg||
nt|3for3:  or any spades hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 1@D is 2+ diamonds I think (don't NS play Precision?)|pg||
nt|chip:  If E were unsure, could bid 3H as a sort of safety bid. Worth a Q-bid if partner has spades, otherwise better not to go past 3H.|pg||
nt|3for3:  If partner is forcing us to bid 2@S, and we have 4 trumps, a stiff, and some useful stuff outside|pg||
nt|3for3:  What is Shenkin to do?|pg||
nt|3for3:  He knows partner has misunderstood his bid; he would have overcalled 1@S with any hand worth 3@S now|pg||
nt|chip:  Probably Hayden found out E was unsure (E is his screenmate), so passed.|pg||
nt|chip:  otherwise N would likely have bid 2S.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfc: Street's turn to huddle.  he confirms that 1!@H showed hearts by Bates|pg||
nt|3for3:  he might have survived the doubling if he passed 3@S, I suspect things will get ugly now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Street and Hayden chatting and Bates asked for quiet.   Bates: "write your jokes"|pg||
nt|glenne:  that might be true, but from barnet's side four hearts could be an easy make|pg||

nt|3for3:  what happened to 14?|pg||
nt|3for3:  last board now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: now the last hand of the set|pg||
nt|3for3:  EW bid a nice slam in other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|smoller:  maybe difficult to find out that Wesr has the right fillers|pg||
mb|3C|an|diamonds|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|smoller:  but rhe little eccentrick 1NT may help|pg||
nt|3for3:  6nt from west is a better spot|pg||
mb|3S|an|cue bid|nt|3for3:  but not so easy to diagnose|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 3@s is cue bid, not shortness, which will be a bit less discouraging for West|pg||
nt|smoller:  I scores better :)|pg||
nt|chip:  with 31 HCP and a solid 6 card suit, pretty normal to bid game.  Strong NT will make it easy I think.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|smoller:	*It scores  better|pg||
nt|chip:  normal to bid slam.|pg||
nt|3for3:  and, I have never had a winner ruffed in NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|3for3:  street worried about 2 fast diamond losers|pg||
nt|3for3:  so he has cued the blacks|pg||
nt|3for3:  duh, HEART losers|pg||
nt|3for3:  I hope everyone knew what I meant....sometimes the fingers and the brain aren't on the same page|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: if 4@H is Key Card and 4NT is natural and NF....|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Shenkin clarifying for everyone what the auction meant|pg||
nt|3for3:  shenkin finally admitted to his heart control, and Street bid what he thought he could make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he thought 3@S was a singleton spade -- Street had written 3@S was a cue bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: 4@D would have been KC|pg||
nt|3for3:  not much to the play here....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: something to think about on the lead however|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hayden asking questions of Street|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfc: Shenking shows his hand|pg||
