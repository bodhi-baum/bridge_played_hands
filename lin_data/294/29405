mb|p|nt|kareno:  LOL Drew, some days it feels like that.  Apparently a diamond was led and that, said the cat, was that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but if a neutral spade lead still makes 7|pg||
nt|kareno:  I guess 3@h was forcing.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: west has to unguard spade queen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: In any case, a good opportunity for Kasle to stop the bleeding to end the day, still 30 boards left to play in this match|pg||
nt|kareno:  True, there is a minor suit squeeze against west or perhaps some sort of compound squeeze that plays out as a simple.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant heart lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my fingers fail to type what my brain says |pg||
nt|kareno:  So true.  And 13 IMPs will give them a little boost into tomorrow with only about three to four swings to make up.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: Roger is in the deep tank, appears to be unsure about 3@h here|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: at some point before last heart you cash clubs to reduce ambiguity|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|kareno:  A triple squeeze including the queen of spades would develop a trick early also.  Looks like 7@h will make if it's bid almost however they lead.|pg||
nt|kareno:  Quite a hand for the last of the day!!|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: is pointed out the ending is still ambiguous|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: wold would have to finesse spade at trick 12 after queen on previous trick|pg||
nt|kareno:  That would become clear I think.  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: not knowing for sure who had the last club|pg||
nt|kareno:  If they bid it, Eddie Wold will make it is my prediction.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming 4@S is RKC   did Bates show "Q" by counting 3rd @H as trump Q  [or maybe 3@H bid says count J instead of Q]|pg||
nt|kareno:  I don't know how many segments each pair needs to play - that's in the conditions which I haven't got in front of me.  I imagine they are on the USBF web site for any who care to look.|pg||
