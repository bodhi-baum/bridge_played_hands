nt|BroLucius:  Looks like N/S might have done OK in 3@D on the last one, but they went plus against 3@C anyway. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Hi, Peter.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  It was a good protective bid by Dhondy in the West seat, not allowing 2@D to play.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Here Cook is warned to keep out of it by East's opening 1@S.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Clinch: Dunn may regret that ultra-light opening|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Usually a trump lead is commended when responder leaves the bidding in opener's second suit, but here South may hope that North can overruff in spades.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|BroLucius:  The club lead has worked well, setting up a club before declarer can establish a discard on the @DK.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: will go about two down whatever, and that might not be so great - if she'd let South open, she might have defended 2@s|pg||
nt|dburn: but now that she has been allowed a trick with @dK, she is out for down "only" one|pg||
nt|dburn: since dummy's clubs are good|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: but that won't do|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  N/S may get too high on this one.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|dburn: this might end up too high|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dburn: but that 2@d bid may put North off - still, it's normal enough to bid 3@h|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North is going to bid 3@H now, otherwise she should have bid 2@H  on the first round.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Nonvul, with balanced distribution and poor diamonds, 2@h would have been enough.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|BroLucius:  A club can go on the spades if the defenders are not quick enough.|pg||
nt|Clinch: and they aren't|pg||
nt|dburn: still, this lead (a reasonable one) will help, though it won't help enough|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|BroLucius:  Americans (who play the strong 1NT) might have kept low with 1@H - 2@H - Pass. Playing a weak 1NT, North would be worried about missing game opposite 15-17 on that sequence.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: She will lose two clubs a heart and a diamond|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Clinch: Or quite hard anyway|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dT|nt|kareno: I don't mind the 1@s response even playing five card majors.  A 4-4 spade fit might play well with hearts to pitch losers.|pg||

Otherwise partner will place you with only two hearts when you give preference to 2@H on the second round.|pg||
nt|Clinch: No underbidding at this table|pg||
nt|dburn: I understand the first bid in this auction, but the others are not so clear|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|kareno: This is pairs?  Very brave bid by east .|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a pairs trial, but the method of scoring is cross-IMPs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North and East both had dubious entries into the auction.|pg||
nt|kareno: At IMPs I don't like it at all.  Let's see if south can duck the first heart from dummy|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North's 2@S was dubious. East's 3@D (transfer) was DUBIOUS.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer might as well play the queen if she does - it's not as if there are a bunch of entries to pick up A/KJx with South|pg||
nt|Clinch: 2@s pretty easy to beat on a singleton @d lead|pg||
nt|kareno: They are channeling the spirit of Rixi Markus |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  A generous assessment.|pg||
nt|Clinch: I'm not sure Rixi would have liked that bidding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|BroLucius:  In general, she only favoured her own bidding.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure Rixi used many transfers. Her partners may have done, of course.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  I once played with her in the Lederer Trophy. Aged me about 5 years.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s9|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Kind of the Great Dealer to start us off with four part-scores.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  South prefers Pass to 1NT.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, after an opening bid by East 4@s is actually a game worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  You would find something on the South cards now, David?|pg||
nt|dburn: I would double if that were penalty, certainly|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  2@H?|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h, I confess, would not be an option for me|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Unlucky to find a doubleton in the dummy.|pg||
nt|dburn: sure it shows diamonds, but...|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  You know partner is short in diamonds.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, North is not all that likely to let 2@h play, I guess|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  I quite like 2@H. Partner should correct to 2@S since you could not overcall 1@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdx: Cook asking questions and consulting the ceiling - having a big think|pg||
mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Ceilings can occasionally be helpful.|pg||
nt|kareno: Double as I play it means a hand with primary diamonds and suggests penalty|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dburn: pass and try to collect some 100s is not a bad option either|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|Clinch: Unlucky this time|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kareno: 50's|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this layout, there may not be very many 100s to collect|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Clinch: Overtricks more likely |pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: especially at this vulnerability, it's true|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  One way or another, it's a poor bidding board for N/S with a spade partial (at least) available.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|Clinch: So Cook probably passed because she didn't want to hear @s bid.... but actually she did|pg||
pc|s3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: still, South did have a 19 count - the auction went badly for her, but she might have done something|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Also a very poor session for the Great Dealer. Five part-scores! Shocking effort for one so powerful.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Clinch: I'd say NS have come out marginally ahead, despite this board|pg||
nt|Clinch: This may be the biggest swing though|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: doubt that there will be many IMPs across the field on this set, it's true|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hA|mc|7|nt|dburn: and some North-Souths may reach 4@s, a reasonable spot unlucky to go down on the lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzdx: Don't go far away - some great boards to come (I hope - I haven't seen them)|pg||
nt|dburn: although I suppose declarer can freeze the club suit and may be able to get a long diamond going - complicated business|pg||
nt|dburn: certainly game would have no chance on a club lead from East, but that would not happen in reality|pg||
nt|kareno: Had south doubled (in my style) the contract would have been a spade partial n/s and that's just fine|pg||
nt|Clinch: EW has morphed mysteriously into Sally Brock and Susannah Gross, another pair likely to end in the mix. I don't know NS, I confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzdx: PLayers have arrived ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|dburn: and Brother Lucius has correctly departed rather than watch another part score|pg||
nt|vugraphzdx: Everything is young to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|an|5M + 4m|nt|Clinch: So late 40s?|pg||
nt|dburn: weak no trump (I hope, or South is an optimist) and East likely to balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@s may be spades and a minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|dburn: double for takeout, and...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: ...well, South took it out, and West cheered up a bit, or even a lot|pg||
nt|Clinch: BBO still reverberating from the double of 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzdx: It was played very delicately!|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|Clinch: I confess I'd have let 1NT go, but fortune in this case favoured the brave|pg||
nt|dburn: still, since 3@d doubled is game (and so would 2@s doubled have been), maybe this wasn't a part score after all|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
