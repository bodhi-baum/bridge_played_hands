mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: Ish often makes this bid with something like 6 or 7 solid in a minor|pg||

pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: BAM = Board-a-Match	aka Point-a-Board|pg||

nt|Fugitiv: Ish seems to know that North had both guarded kings and is relentlessly toying with him|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|Fugitiv: a good hand to do that on|pg||

nt|ahollan1: your question leads back to why many think about 1@S-PASS|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yes hard to see you making game on the south hand|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: and you probably aren't too worried if the opponents come in either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  and the realized risks of	partner either rebidding @S or playing a moysian @H fit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on plus side  1N or 2minor contract would be improvement|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: At least from Souths point of view he doesn't have to play this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all of this is moot outside of limited opening bid    so in 2/1, acol, std  south MUST respond|pg||

nt|Nigel: Best to ruff @s and @ds rather than cash spade winners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trailing Markey by 6|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: or as I'm informed even better to ruff his big spades, so he can ruff diamonds on the way back|pg||

nt|Fugitiv: yeah Gill could have done a couple of tricks better here, the problem was the big spades he had|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: if he didn't have those he would have just crossruffed 4 tricks|pg||
