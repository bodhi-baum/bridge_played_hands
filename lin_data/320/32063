nt|Kyosuke326:	but he only need Kxxx x xx Qxxxxx|pg||
nt|eieio: EW needs IMPs and N isn't sure about 4@S|pg||

nt|Kyosuke326:	4@H is a margin contract, hard to play and defense.|pg||
nt|lorderic: you mean 4@H with W hand Edward?|pg||
nt|eieio: I would actually bid 4@H right after 2@D, I need ca$h :-)|pg||
nt|by: I am sure that west knew that they needed IMPs.	but perhaps, I might gamble an invite with E hand, I need IMPs as east too.|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:	yes, after 3@S|pg||
nt|eieio: Partner's suit is usually correct here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eieio: A heart to W allows him to swtich to his singleton minor|pg||
nt|Kyosuke326:	I hope to pick @CJ if needed, guess spade right if needed... do anything if needed, kerker|pg||
