nt|lorderic: closed room bid aggressively to 3NT this hand and went down|pg||
nt|lorderic: hello edward :)|pg||
nt|eieio: Hi Edward|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lorderic: people nowadays tend to open EVERY 11 counts|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|eieio: W makes a pushy jump shift|pg||
nt|lorderic: W makes the same 3@D jump shift as the other table does|pg||
nt|lorderic: i guess they do not play gazilli - 3@D is not alerted|pg||
nt|eieio: 4@S would make, but not 3NT|pg||
nt|kyosuke326:	This is a very touch-and-go 3N with lots of endplay possibilities ...... |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lorderic: 3@S by E is better than 3NT in my opinion. now they got a chance to land in 4@S|pg||
nt|eieio: With both spades and diamonds 3-3, EW can make 4@S|pg||
nt|eieio: I like 3@S too|pg||
nt|eieio: With ruffing potential in diamonds and @CA, 4@S might be better|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lorderic: i wonder why W is thinking now? passing 3@S? :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kyosuke326:	I think he is likely thinking of passing 3@s|pg||
nt|kyosuke326:	No I am wrong, |pg||
nt|eieio: Well, 5@D also make|pg||
nt|kyosuke326:	are you sure that it makes on three rounds of @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eieio: You're right|pg||
nt|lorderic: ruffing the third @H for upper cut|pg||
nt|eieio: S can ruff the third heart to promote a trump|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|c3|pc|sK|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|lorderic: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|lorderic: it's not easy for N to stop before game after south overcalls|pg||

nt|lorderic: by the way, do you guys open with E's hand?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eieio: 1@S is probably forcing in the other room, so 1N by S didn't promise more points than 7-8|pg||
nt|lorderic: uh that's a good way to stop short|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eieio: For me, 1@S is constructive but not forcing, so I like the pass from S|pg||
nt|eieio: Declarer sees 24 points combined, and E opens 1@D|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lorderic: in closed room, N made an offshape 2NT opening and caught by his partner ...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|eieio: I don't blame people opening that kind of 2NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eieio: It's often hard to show such a powerhouse after opening 1@C|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|eieio: You need a lot of practice to be able to tell your partner how strong your hand is|pg||
nt|lorderic: it's not only offshape but also light - N got stiff @HQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|eieio: And in collegiate event, I think opening 2NT is fine.|pg||
nt|eieio: That's right|pg||
nt|eieio: A stiff @HK would be a better hand to open 2NT|pg||

nt|lorderic: a dead minimum for take-out double, and only 3 hearts!|pg||
