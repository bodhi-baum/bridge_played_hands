nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|frankaus: cash out 4 -1 or will ish use his immagination|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a way for declarer to prevent defense from scoring at least 5 tricks?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this brings -4 into play|pg||
nt|frankaus: 50's :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think [keyword]	Gill can count Ish for 6@C  to go with 2@D   so  at very least Hans has @SA|pg||
nt|frankaus: both def quite familiar with ish|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: hihi|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcm|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Not sure if you've mentioned this but Nunn opened 1nt (15-17) in the other room too|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: another point that i missed	 if Ish held @SK  he would have lead @S after @CA rather than @H|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: He chose a different, but good line of playing a diamond back to the 9 hoping Qj was onside, and that the opponents would realise they had to cash out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://livebridge.net/livevideo/	 we're	BBO2 Open Room|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: which they wouldn't with the clubs hidden|pg||
nt|ahollan1: facing us	 on left: Sartaj Hans	on right Ish Del'Monte|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Ish wondering if Gill could have both the Q and J of diamonds|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: he doesn't have many other chances at this point|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Its vaguely possible that Peter with QJ to 4 diamonds might think East has the 8 and declarer will play the 7 if he switches a low one|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: oh no forget that east would play the 8 at trick one|pg||
nt|babs59: I think that Peter knows Ish has 6 clubs and Ish is working out Peter wouldn't be that 'stupid'|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm reaching now --  is it possible that Gill didn't think @C9 @C10 were completely honest cards?|pg||
nt|babs59: no|pg||
nt|babs59: :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've run out of guesses to explain the @D continuations|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Fugitiv: but maybe declarer has 4 clubs?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|babs59: more likely they were some sort of SP or Smith|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why @C @C to ace with only 4-card suit	 versus @C to A and immediate play in @H?|pg||
nt|babs59: sorry SP = suit preference|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s5|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|babs59: the heart play looks odd, but equally Peter knows that Ish is separated from dummy's @DA|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|s8|nt|babs59: he didn't continue spades for fear of giving Ish a free finesse AND an entry to dummy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: first names around the table   N: Peter  E: Sartaj  S: Ish  W: Peter|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Fugitiv: a spade would be unlikely to cost though? if Ish didn't convert with 3 spades and 2 diamonds, fairly unlikely|pg||
pc|sT|nt|babs59: and North is also Peter but commonly called PETE|pg||
nt|babs59: West is PETER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|babs59: and sorry, but he's my brother so I simply find it impossible to call him GILL|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: likewise :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@C must be any minimum|pg||
nt|babs59: even if a club lead by West, declarer still has 2 spade losers (and the two trump losers)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: would you upgrade it Gos?	I think it's lacking intermediate cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i would have thought a mere Texas transfer for North|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think using 4@C/@D as slam try makes more sense than 4@D/@H  because the intermediate step is available as an encouraging hedge|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|h6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - they used 4C as slam try in hearts etc.  (Lambardi and M Thomson of Lorentz team)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: but i suppose	with 4@D/@H as 1-under slam try  you can allow opener to either ASK or SHOW keycards|pg||
