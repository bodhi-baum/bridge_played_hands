mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: here, she might stretch to bid 3@s, to show some values|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, five spades and diamond control looks encouraging and now West might think her hand too good to pass|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: close, not vulnerable|pg||
nt|paulg:  a suggestion that a different ace would be more valuable, so perhaps going low at this vulnerability is better|pg||
nt|dburn: but she will regard dK as more of an asset than it is - she would prefer partner not to have @dA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|paulg:  quite an effort to think of a layout where you could get close to making this|pg||
