mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mug: ultra-pessimistic by Liz McGowan in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mug: South could easily have had a singleton spade, with which 7@D is a claim|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dburn: trouble is, you can't bid a grand slam on the trump finesse any more|pg||
mb|p|nt|joefawcett:  2NT forcing, to see partner's shape.|pg||
nt|dburn: because that missing key card might be a real ace|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mug: Fawcett seems to have set diamonds as trumps, for what purpose I don't know|pg||
nt|dburn: she's trying to get Moore to control-bid in hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: To achieve a push?|pg||
nt|dburn: she will doubtless unset diamonds in favour of spades at the end|pg||
nt|mug: for sure, but why not just RKC over 2@S and then ask for the @DK?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Moore is wondering how to discourage her partner|pg||
nt|paulg:  isn't this the only way to bid the grand?|pg||
nt|mug: we can but hope|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely that's a joke|pg||
nt|joefawcett:	Because there might be two heart losers (on a very bad day).|pg||
nt|dburn: or, it may be that partner's @hK needs protecting from the opening lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mug: surely what's a joke?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: talk of a grand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|mug: yes, quite so|pg||

nt|dburn: not really - suppose Soth has @sKxx  @hKx  @dKxxxxx  @cQJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now then which suit have we agreed?|pg||
nt|dburn: then, you want partner to declare 6@d, not you to declare anything|pg||
nt|runnerup:  6 @d looks better than 6 @s in case K10xx badly placed in @s's|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: how many is that?|pg||
nt|paulg:  and they've already had one fortunate key card accident, probably not the auction they wanted at the end of the day|pg||
