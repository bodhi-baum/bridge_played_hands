nt|yorkbeach:  possibilty of setting up hearts|pg||

pc|h2|nt|warrens:  well, he found it|pg||
nt|Chick: but is it more likely than 3-3 hearts?|pg||
nt|dburn:  he may not need 3-3 hearts|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a good day, this can make without 3-3 @H's|pg||
nt|dburn:  he can aim at a cross-ruff, or if the defenders play trumps, then (if he sees they are 3-2) he can revert to diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dburn:  and to answer a previous question, 4-3 diamonds is about 62% and 3-2 trumps about 68%, so in isolation that is slightly more likely  than 3-3 hearts, but not by much|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  another option presents itself|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if 3 @d tricks are available, declarer just needs trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  discard the club to make certain that the defenders cannot force dummy|pg||
nt|dburn:  he only needs two diamond tricks, one ruff in dummy, two aces, and five trumps|pg||
nt|ady: west does better not to take ace of diamonds    but with hearts kind  no way to go down now|pg||

nt|mug: hasn't gone down yet|pg||
nt|mug: a few boards ago you complimented ARF on not leading a singleton|pg||
nt|athene: but with such a weak hand you would expect south to lead the singleton|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|mug: perhaps South will think the @CJ lead in order, on the bidding?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mug: 3NT was some kind of rolling bid|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps Robson will bid clubs at some point and north will double for the lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: @H10 wins whenever North has a major-suit ace, but South may go for the slow club trick route|pg||

nt|Chick: one person can pass forcing his partner to make the decision to bid or double.  The idea is that you cannot just pass out the sacrifice, you have to either bid on or punish the ...|pg||
