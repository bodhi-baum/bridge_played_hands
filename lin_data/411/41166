mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cascade: meanwhile in the other room Whibley Brown took six rounds to get to 4@s|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|2Smiths:  average players find the interference hard to cope with, so getting in there on weak hand has a higher upside|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|2Smiths:  experts not so much, but they are also quick to take advantage of the information to play hands better than otherwise|pg||
nt|2Smiths:  the last hand is a little bit similar to one hand currently being held out as an example of someone having unauthorised information|pg||
