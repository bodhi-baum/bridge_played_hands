pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|odysseus69: what views about norths lead- i know it didnt matter here but interesting to me|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this lead seems to have worked well- I suppose only a club lead would be bad for defence|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that killed the defence|pg||
nt|ahollan1: breaking frozen suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: the heart queen killed the defence - seems pointless|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i suppose meckstroth trying to talk declarer into heart finesse rather than diamond finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: meck normally fast player -- if he did NOT hold @CJ, wouldn't he continue @C faster?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: because its Meckstroth Robson knows he can make this ploay with AK of clubs but will get it right eventually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that also assumes rodwell will switch to @C4 from garbage  [including unsupported Jack]|pg||
