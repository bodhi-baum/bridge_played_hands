nt|mrdct:  don't get too comfortable, as this is just a 4-board match between the winners of the teams championship and a challenger team made up of various expert players hanging around the event|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this year's teams champions are shane harrison, sam schulz, rhys cooper and ella pattison who lead most of the way but had to survive a difficult draw in the last 3 rounds|pg||
nt|mrdct:  probably something 1NT for EW here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:	milne might stretch an invite|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mrdct:	in BAM, 2NT would ordinarily be to play, not lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|mrdct:	ew perhaps not on the same page here|pg||
nt|mrdct:  this wont play well and look like a win for the Youth Team|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|mrdct:  the website for this event is http://www.abfevents.com.au/events/ayc/2014/results.asp|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure who we have for the challengers in the other room - possibly alex smirnov and griff ware|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|mrdct:  i'm told it is alex and griff in the closed room|pg||
nt|mrdct:  by tradition the winners of the cliff wake trophy will all have their names misspelt when the trophy is engraved|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mrdct:  it is also a tradition that every youth player at the venue kibitzes this match so there will about 30 kibitzers at each table|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|mrdct:  later this evening after dinner the selection trials for the Australian Youth Team will commence which run through to Sunday|pg||
pc|s6|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mrdct:  there will BBO coverage of the final stages of the trials on the weekend|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|mrdct:  an aggressive trap pass by west, but he knows that he almost certainly lost the 1st board|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  declarer looks like he can limit himself to 2 trump losers, 1 @S, 1@D and 1@C|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mrdct:  a problem for delcarer is a lack of entry to dummy, so he may wind up needing to play @c himself|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mrdct:  on brd 1, the Youth picked up penalties in both rooms but whether the net is 10 or 800 it's still just 1 BAM point|pg||
nt|mrdct:  south and west may exchange some ruffs here|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i very seldom play BAM, so i'm by no means an expert on the strategy, but aggressive partscore doubles at this vul seem to make sense|pg||
nt|mrdct:  -110 is probably going to be just as bad as -470 so you might as well try to turn +100 into +200|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mrdct:  +200 wins the board in BAM more often than not|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mrdct:  for late arrivers, this year's teams champions are shane harrison, sam schulz, rhys cooper and ella pattison who lead most of the way but had to survive a difficult draw in the last 3 rounds|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the website for this event is http://www.abfevents.com.au/events/ayc/2014/results.asp|pg||
nt|mrdct:  sam schulz is making a comeback to bridge after sitting out the last 3 years to concentrate on his studies|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and doing it in style|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm guessing slightly, but i think NS are both 22|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|c2|nt|mrdct:  in the closed room, Rhys Cooper is about 21 and Ella Pattison is 19|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|mrdct:  so on brd 2 2@s made in the other room, so the double was potentially crucial if delcarer here had found a way to go one off|pg||
nt|mrdct:  5@c makes|pg||
mb|3H!|an|fsj|nt|mrdct:  but so does 5@s|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mrdct:  perhaps a lead directing 5@d now|pg||
nt|mrdct:  south's hand is not suited for defence|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  wow - shane harrison taking a big view here|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  6@s may make on non @h lead|pg||
nt|mrdct:  nah - the tricks aren't there|pg||
nt|babs59: 7@C?|pg||
nt|babs59: Liam's thinking|pg||
nt|mrdct:  west might be thiking about 7@c|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|babs59: for sure, after all Shane Harrison certainly bid confidently|pg||
nt|mrdct:  clearly south is void @c and sounds like he has some fitting @h cards|pg||
nt|babs59: Milne had to double for the 'win' on this board|pg||
nt|babs59: so the last board will decide the Cliff Wake Challenge|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yes - closed room result is in and it was the same contract which will also be -1 here|pg||
nt|babs59: though, of course, it could be a draw too|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|babs59: I think they have 1 board playoffs if it's a tie?  do you know Dave?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|sT|nt|mrdct:  i'm not exactly sure|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|babs59: it used to be IMPs and was always a cliff-hanger anyway (pun intended)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|mc|11|nt|mrdct:  i think it does go to 1 board play-offs|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SKHAKQ96DAJT7C643,SAJ54H7DK42CAQT92,SQ972HJ8DQ963CKJ8,ST863HT5432D85C75|sv|b|nt|babs59: the tradition of engraving names comes from the title of the event...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|babs59: Griff Ware entered some congress only to find his name as Cliff Wake (he writes badly)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm told by the CTD that the tie-break method is to IMP score it|pg||
nt|babs59: the name stuck, and this Youth event was named after 'him' |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  so no extra boards|pg||
nt|babs59: well board 1 was 13 IMPs to Harrison|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  and the Youth Team Winners are leading on IMPs|pg||
nt|babs59: board 2 was 9 IMPs to Challengers|pg||
nt|babs59: board 3 was flat|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mrdct:  choice between 3NT and 4@h here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  east's @s8 is a potentially huge card|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think you need to guess to hook the @h here to make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|babs59: Sam Schulz and Shane Harrison are from SA.  They were a long-standing partnership till about 3 years ago when Schulz gave up bridge to focus on his studies.  This is his return to ...|pg||
nt|babs59: the gave - so far so good|pg||
pc|sK|nt|babs59: 3NT in CR but from South - much better1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i think he's in trouble|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mrdct:  the overtrick in 3NT in the closed room should be good for the win|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrdct:  there's that @S8|pg||
nt|babs59: even making was good for the win Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct:  true|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so the challengers will win and get to have their names misspelt on the perpetual trophy|pg||
nt|babs59: they certainly play a lot of bridge in these few days|pg||
nt|babs59: 9 x 8 board matches yesterday|pg||
nt|babs59: 6 x 8 board matches so far today (plus 4 for the Cliff Wake)|pg||
nt|babs59: and now they have 2 matches of the Butler to select our U26 Youth Team|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yes - generally 3 sessions of serious bridge per day plus late night crazy pairs, goulash and speedballs|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the selection trials for the australian youth team start this evening|pg||
nt|babs59: or just crazy games of various sorts :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  we will be showing the last 2 days of it (sat & sun) on BBO|pg||
nt|babs59: this year's event is in the middle of nowhere - trust me, I dropped my daughter off there - so there's no Canberra or city to head to at night|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yass is fairly close|pg||
nt|babs59: Canberra is a good 45-50 minute drive away|pg||
nt|babs59: does Yass qualify as a city?|pg||
nt|mrdct:  it has plenty of pubs|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|babs59: and even more random breath test stops!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pc|hA|mc|8|nt|babs59: I always used to be pulled over for an RBT having driven 12 hours from Adelaide :)|pg||
nt|mrdct:  but it's nice having an entire conference venue to yourself|pg||
nt|mrdct:  thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|babs59: and everyone actually staying there is fun too|pg||
nt|mrdct:  see you back in a few days time for the end of the youth trials|pg||
