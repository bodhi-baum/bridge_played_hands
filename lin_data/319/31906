nt|cuttysark: Hmm|pg||
nt|capercliff:	might as well have been in 3N:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bit of point counting would tell North that South had @DA|pg||
mb|1H|nt|capercliff:  yes, particularly after the @h's were cashed|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|capercliff:  hmm that might work out to be a good 3@c bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: This should avoid 3NT, but may still reach an unmakeable spot|pg||
nt|capercliff:	doesn't this show 6@h and an unbalanced hand when play weak nt?|pg||
nt|capercliff:	or is 2@h still a catch all bid?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He ought to be 6-4, but the only alternative is to open 1NT, which is also flawed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@H is is only choci over 2@D and may easily be only 5|pg||
mb|4D|nt|cuttysark: And he could be 1-5-2-5 (thank you DB)|pg||
nt|capercliff:	i dont like the way this auction is panning out but then again I'm not a big fan of weak nt and 4-majors anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cuttysark: Not sure that 2-over-one would do too well here either|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West is cuebidding. Spade lead surely marked now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (I guess South will have no real lead problem here whatever)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: This may be the only making game!|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But the 4-1 diamond break is still hard to handle - need to force dummy to ruff a spade|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|paulg:  but West makes a try with his fitting diamond honour, so now they may rest in 4@d|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|paulg:  checking their card 2@d is game forcing, so no real option for West|pg||
