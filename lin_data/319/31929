nt|cuttysark: 2@H in the re-opening seat is Intermediate, never weak. Still....|pg||

nt|paulg:  Sime may respond 2@d|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|ady: 6@D played by south looks the best spot	very difficult to reach|pg||
nt|paulg:  this looks like a slam hand the diamonds more important than spades|pg||

nt|paulg:  i think it is just a splinter|pg||
