mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|paulg:  2NT will be a 4-card spade raise and I think 3@c suggests non-minimum overcall|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulg:  declarer might have covered the heart lead and let North wonder what to lead next|pg||
nt|paulg:  as North will lead a small heart when gets the lead in a minor suit, Shields might well play a minor first before playing a trump|pg||
nt|paulg:  as spades 3-1 will become a little uncomfortable if North gets the lead twice as he will expect he will|pg||
nt|paulg:  a tricky hand first thing in the morning, perhaps better that Shields is playing it rather than Filip Kurbalija|pg||
nt|paulg:  who is less of a morning person|pg||
nt|paulg:  (I seem to recall)|pg||
nt|paulg:  the other reason to avoid trumps initially is that these are your entries for playing the minor suits|pg||
nt|paulg:  I think this is the second year that Barton/Spears have played in the Camrose as a partnership, Spears having played in many other partnerships in the past|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|paulg:  5@d is a surprise bid, no wonder it took a while|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|4C!|nt|capercliff:  a wet pass of 3@d by North?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@C looks OK. Too much work in 4@S I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I think 3@S on this auction would be forcing, and he is surely not worth that - pretty grubby flat 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Now he bids 4@S - not sure how his hand has got better|pg||
nt|capercliff:  well if you are going to play at the 4 level it might as well be a game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Tim McKay and Derek Sanders EW for Scotland are playing something vaguely like Acol http://www.bridgewebs.com/bgb/Sanders.pdf|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Th Scottish West likes to bid - but surely even he.....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They play a weak NT and a 5-card spade suit|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|paulg:  i think Barton is making a 3-card limit raise through 1NT, but this allows Shields to get both suits into the game at a low level|pg||
mb|3C|nt|paulg:  but the big decision will be Shields after 4@s is bid|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@c will pass or correct, looking for East's minor|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  North forced to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|paulg:  but not unhappy as strong raises with 3@h were available|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shields might well bid 5@c directly here, putting the pressure on|pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulg:  these pairs will not know each other quite as well as some others in the event, but quite a lot of psychology in these situations|pg||
nt|paulg:  do i bid 5@c immediately, what about 4@c and then 5@c|pg||
