mb|p|nt|Finch:	6@C-1 looks extremely likley|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|Finch:  I'm prepared to believe 6@S-1, although that looks as if it should make|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Finch:  I think I'd better not speculate|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|jacksond:  Yes the Japanese have a word for the contract in the other room if it was 6C. Something to do with ritual sucide|pg||
mb|p|nt|Finch:	4@H agrees spades, doesn't necessarily have first round control because it is the only way to agree spades|pg||
nt|Finch:  Allerton's 3@S bid will usually be 6 cards as he has room to bid 3@D or 3@H (fourth suit) with a less spadey hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Finch:  This is likely to end in 6@S when they work out the @SQ is missing|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|Finch:  Allerton it is purist, he bids 5@S in case partner has 1 (even though that is impossible)|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|Finch:  5NT confirms 4 keycards but denies the @SQ (I think)|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jacksond:  This is know as ALLWOOD convention. If you show 0/3 Aces then you must bid slam on next round after partner signs off if you have 3|pg||
nt|Finch:  or indeed 1/4|pg||
nt|vugraphzcc: Lots of questions by the Irish pair|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Finch:  Allerton showing confidence that they know what they are doing i.e. that he can find out if partner has the @SQ over 5@S|pg||
nt|Finch:  Club lead stands out here, as dummy is very likely to have a singleton heart|pg||
nt|Finch:  Interesting play problem|pg||
nt|Finch:  Looking at all four hands, we can see that 13 tricks are easy via draw trumps, ruffing heart finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Finch:  but if trumps are 3-1 and diamonds are 4-3 he can play CA, DA, D ruff, AK of spades, DK,|pg||
