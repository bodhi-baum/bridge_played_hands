nt|marlowepi:  unfortunately for him clubs are 4-1, but that is actually not terrible news because it may mean 3N fails too|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  E can see that if S lacks heart ace he has opened on 9 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: Overtake and play trumps?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  on the other hand, if he had H ace he would probably have done more than sign off in 5C|pg||

mb|1C|nt|marlowepi:  when your agreed suit is spades, there is less tactical pressure to favor the big preempt than when it is hearts|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi:  S has an interesting choice, many	--  perhaps most  -- would bid 1H but do you like your hand well enough to double for takeout on the next round, especially at these colors? it is a genuine problem|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: what's your tactical approach here, double or 1@H? I tend to bid 1@S when having 5 spades and 4 hearts, what about these holdings?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|5H|nt|marlowepi:  right, it is not a comfortable situation since you cannot later conveniently explore possibilities in the other major while allowing for preference at the 2 level|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbg: I bet South initial double would make decision a little easier here for North|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi:  E sort of unlucky that the 3rd D in the W hand is not a heart instead, though the abundance of controls in the E hand does suggest that NS who have bid 5H at unfavorable colors, when all S did was overcall, have at least 11 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: I bet he's thinking whether to play low or high from the dummy|pg||

mb|4H|mb|5C|nt|HedyG:  what now? X or 5@c?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|HedyG:  hard for Fantoni to believe after the X by S and a free 4@H bid vulnerable by N that A@S is in N|pg||
nt|HedyG:  the hammer coming down on any further bid by N|pg||
nt|HedyG:  NS are a new partnership, not sure Pachtman doesnt expect more for a vulnerable t/o from his pd|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzbn: i think Pachtman alerted Tarnovski's pass over 5@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: if pass was forcing, 500 is cheaper than 550 :)|pg||
nt|HedyG:  it is pretty common usage to play pass as forcing when you have bid a vulnerable game and opps sacrifice. just here it was not a sac|pg||
nt|HedyG:  yes S had the option to double 5@c but as Ognjen says, that is 550|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: closed room bid 6@c over 5@h|pg||
nt|HedyG:  at the OT they pushed E into 6@cX -1|pg||
nt|HedyG:  yes S overcalled 1@H there and W bid 5@c, so N bid 5@H|pg||
