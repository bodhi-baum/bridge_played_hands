mb|4S|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|vugraphzbg: These are kids :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  many players who cleave to "Principle of Fast Arrival" would insist 3H must be stronger than 4H. But sometimes you want to be able to offer a choice of games|pg||

nt|pelu:  Lucky U Marshall :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: Should 5@D here be first round control?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  however if you play that 3H in this sequence is very wide-ranging (i.e. EITHER very good for hearts OR a choice of games) then you can't use a 3N rebid by Responder to distinguish between serious vs. nonserious slam tries|pg||
