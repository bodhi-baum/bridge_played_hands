nt|vugraphzbg: Aronov having the best cards today :)|pg||
nt|shengabus:  My guess is that some Leaping Michaels treatment|pg||
nt|shengabus:  With spades, bid spades|pg||
nt|shengabus:  4@h = d+c better c|pg||
nt|shengabus:  4N = d+c better d|pg||
nt|runnerup:  so can you jutze now 5nt pick ..or what --5 @d's?|pg||
nt|shengabus:  That's my guess, along leaping michaels lines|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: have seen simpler leaping michaels treatments - 4@C showing clubs and another for one :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  13|pg||
nt|runnerup:  in nt also|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: 3@C cooked them well|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Obviously with yet another tank by West, another undiscussed torture :)|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: 3@H|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: sry|pg||
nt|shengabus:  If partner has short h, the ops have 10 of 'em|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: what else he could do?|pg||
nt|runnerup:  dont pass -dont sit too long|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: this time cursing fates won't help|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: I'm pretty sure he won't pass 4@H :)|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: he'd have to bid eventually|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: maybe he could try 4@S and hope pard has a void :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  west must raise if east can bid 5 in a minor|pg||
nt|runnerup:  4nt .5 @c--raise or?|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: :) i like that 4@S even more then|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: advance cuebid? :):)|pg||
nt|shengabus:  How about 5@h :) You pick :)|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: well, that was my first pick (scroll up a bit)|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: but you mentioned torture and cruelty :)|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: is Bocchi urging him to bid faster?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: Stefanov is the most nervous player at the table :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  5 @h was my 1. impression too|pg||
nt|shengabus:  I think we're both recommending not bidding 4@h|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|shengabus:  I said 5@h only facetiously|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|BSpiljak: see, 4@S :)|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now -raise or some @d's|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: and now, moment of truth|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Peter, to repeat, I meant 5@h only facetiously|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: Madala went to the toillete and back. Maybe even to the store and back having so much time :)|pg||
nt|shengabus:  I think West put in a no-win situation by 4@h|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: Stefanov would be happy with 4@S if only he had low doubleton or singleton|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this wasn't a clear place ..it still isn't|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|BSpiljak: boom!|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup:  pick a slam|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shengabus:  West at least pleased to finally be sure about strain|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: he picked 6@D since pard was obviously not thrilled with clubs|pg||
nt|shengabus:  There was some doubt at 5@c that spades might have been agreed|pg||
nt|shengabus:  Yuck!|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: so nice to find suit at 6 level|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: kids, this is not a thing to try at home :)|pg||
nt|shengabus:  I think the children have already grown up watching this set|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: Not even at kitchen bridge? :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|runnerup:  so this was near 5nt 2, round -just covering @s's in case east has 7-5 or so |pg||
