nt|odysseus69: the concept of A National League is a good one although I aam not familiar with how this one weorks to produce a final.|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Symons, which is the Scotland Women's team, surprisingly beat Brian Short's team in the semifinal|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:	Sam Punch is only just back from a few months sabbatical in the USA|pg||
nt|paulg:  this included getting to the round of 16 in the Spingold, which was a great achievement|pg||
nt|odysseus69: where she did well in US Nationals in Atlanta|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Alan1719:  people upgrade too much these days in my view - particularly as partners drive game on sub minimal values as well|pg||
nt|paulg:  This match also features a brother and sister in competition - Alex and Sheila Adamson,|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  interesting OL against a strictly natural 1C and presumably no majors in the South hand. wouldn't have been my choice|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am sure that 1 club promised 4 and South denied a 4 card major- I would have opted for a spade lead but with the club 9 I would swing to clubs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|odysseus69: should really start with Ace and Jack of diamonds|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|paulg:  especially give the lead which suggests club length with West, so @dKx in East very unlikely|pg||

nt|Alan1719:  EW do have to be slightly careful here. it is possible to let this one through at this stage|pg||
nt|paulg:  by pitching a diamond on the fourth heart Marshall already taking some care|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East should have played the spade Ace  -now partner can go wrong|pg||
nt|paulg:  i expect West is considering whether to cash one club before returning the spade|pg||

mc|10|nt|Phil352:  that's a good one to finish the stansa on for EW|pg||
nt|gipsona:  the first big swing|pg||
nt|gipsona:  have some sympathy for south - - would have been tempted to play 8@d from north hand|pg||
nt|Phil352:  from S's perspective, if N held the A@H he probably could have cashed it before the diamond|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so second drop of the day by harry, then?|pg||
nt|gipsona:  chasing H ace - migh get rid of diamond losers if west had ace empty|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: ok - will wait for closed room to finish.  We'll close both tables and restart in 5 mins or so...|pg||
nt|gipsona:  so diamond shift ok but 5 puts too much pressure on pd to read|pg||
nt|Phil352:  W was on table though|pg||
nt|gipsona:  ok good point :)|pg||
nt|gipsona:  less sympathy now|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: SMITH team only have four of their six players available today.|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: SYMONS won seating rights for first set.  Not sure what that means for the second. |pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: variations in the NT range produce a high number of swings |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|Alan1719:  3H showed I suspect a good 3 card raise (assuming Liz plays what she played with me)|pg||
nt|paulg:  NS playing 4-card majors and weak notrump, so Punch either has 5 spades or strong notrump|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i often get tempted with 5-4-3-1 but not Sam Punch-|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 3@h removes some pressure when she is strong|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  Sam did amazingly well to bid only 3S. I would have bid 4S automatically|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'd be a lot happier with a singleton heart and the ace in another suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  but her spade suit is poor and it is non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  when you see he dummy you have no idea if you have done the right thing or not!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I fancy you to make 10 tricks here Alan as should Sam imo|pg||

nt|Alan1719:  now you have no idea whether you have gained or lost imps....|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|paulg:  not a great defensive effort helping declarer to ten tricks, but the question is whether they'd do this in a game contract?|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  this is an excellent slam, but getting to it is a very tough ask.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|paulg:  they are playing with screens so Marshall's 4NT will not appear so quickly on the other side of the screen|pg||

nt|paulg:  Last hand in this set, they'll score up and be back within a few minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: there is a world wide virus that makes people open on balanced 11 counts but has not reached Scotland yet|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  5D is a lot better that 3NT but this time your luck is in|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I think Alan suggested on board 4, the only legitimate way to let it make was to try and give a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hope 2C and not doubble|pg||
nt|paulg:  which happened in the other room|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:	I thought the only reason to play 14-16 1NT is to allow you to open balanced 11 counts|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  now now Victor, don't show off your slid credentials. many open flat 10s now and the last time I played with a Hackett a 4333 9 count was opened..|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!S raise w/out A/K!S + !C values|mb|2D|nt|paulg:  i expect 2@c is naturalish but promises a spade honour|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Alan1719:  do we know what 2C is? looks sophisticated!|pg||
nt|paulg:  both pairs in the Smith team focus heavily on showing or denying honour support in competition|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Alan1719:  may well be heading for 5D now. please note that if 3NT makes almost all of the time 6D makes as well....|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: really dislike the	double unless 2C not forcing - with good game going hands best to bid your shape- the 5th club only becomes apparent to partner  whenthe hand records arrive|pg||
mb|3S|nt|paulg:  i'm pretty sure that 2@c would be forcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|Alan1719:  really interesting choice of 3H from Liz|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  and I can't imagine why Punch didn't bid it, unless she wanted to get hearts into the game before spade pre-emption|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 diamons is as good as 3NT|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  in my view Sam should not pass 3NT now. partner didn't bid 2NT over 2S doubled so cannot have that great a stop (though has bid a free 3NT)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: many play that xx promises Ace of spades|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Alan1719:  the bidding to date actually marks Liz more or less with the distribution she has|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: partner volunteered 2 diamonds - must be at least what she has- clear to play in diamonds|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||

nt|Alan1719:  the 4S we saw let through and out again in this room was let through next door by the method I suggested - a D to the ace and an attempted ruff...oops|pg||
