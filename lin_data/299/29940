nt|vugraphzbn:	essay writing going on on both sides of screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: but as usual i can't see!|pg||
nt|Alan1719:  slightly unusual methods. more normal is lower cue shows raise and higher cue shows fourth suit. maybe not so sensible when 3C shows neither suit|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Alan1719:  I think showing a 2 suited with AKxxxx in a major and 10xxxx in a minor is horrible. still works this time!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: i don't know what was written - mere guess work from me|pg||
nt|Phil352:  they probably just have the general agreement of how to deal with an unusual 2nt and have applied it|pg||
mb|5C|nt|Phil352:  3@D would be strong takeout, 3@H a spade raise and then 4@C can be natural and competitive|pg||

nt|paulg:  if EW were playing splinters, then 4@c would get the job done quickly|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|nt|paulg:  but perhaps 4@c would be a fit jump from West so he can only show a good raise|pg||

nt|Alan1719:  looks a normal contract and with the cards lying this well any line looks like it will bring it home|pg||
