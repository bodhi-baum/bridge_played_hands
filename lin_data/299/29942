nt|idc: but his -2800 didn't score well|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: HS likes to use all the cards in the bidding box|pg||
nt|idc: I'm asked what 4@h was - presumably natural since North's 2NT was limited to invitational to game|pg||
nt|idc: But it may depend on what the alerted 3@d meant and CC doesn't say|pg||

mb|4H|nt|paulg:  2 out of 3 finesses means 50% chance|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Punch afraid to double because it wouldn't be pure penalty|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  but will lose 8 IMPs because of that|pg||

nt|ady: last hand of the set	  thx all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  they'll restart after a quick score up and grabbing a coffee|pg||
mb|p|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulg:  @sQ asks for reverse attitude, so Punch knows not to continue the suit|pg||
nt|ady: north opened in other room   1@C   1@S	east  and 1NT south all pass|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: so Smith plays 1NT in both rooms|pg||
nt|paulg:  and will probably make it in both|pg||
nt|paulg:  no switch looks attractive here and North has been unable to signal|pg||
nt|paulg:  Punch will suspect that Marshall has five spades|pg||
