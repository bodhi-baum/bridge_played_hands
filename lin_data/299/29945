nt|paulg:  West might hold seven diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzbn: This is first time these pairs have played today so convention cards being studied|pg||
nt|idc: Welcome all to set 6 (if my arithmetic is correct)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: you like lots of bidding, then Ian?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: quite a strong NT from west|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|idc: McGowan very strong for just 1NT but 2NT is an inelegant leap and may punish a partner with a light dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: 3@s is not to play says Sam (East)|pg||
nt|idc: And only one @s stop - but still, very strong|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but not sure re 3 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: my guess is showing doubtful spade stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|idc: West means it to show spade doubt, but might East take it as Staymanic?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbn: Sam saying undiscussed (so I was wrong - West hasn't said /i think)|pg||
nt|idc: Probably shouldn't since West could have bid hearts earlier or 3@h now with 4 of them|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|h5|pg||
