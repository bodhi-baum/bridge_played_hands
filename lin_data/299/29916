nt|STRIK3R: A bit aggressive 3NT from west|pg||

mc|8|nt|KingCur: 5 imps|pg||

nt|KingCur: this match is played over this weekend in six stanzas of 16 boards|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  as far as I see chances almost zero to make it|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  unless a slip at defense|pg||
nt|KingCur: not this way, though|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  yes very unlikely, defenders work not hard |pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 4@h was not a bad spot to be in, unlucky @h looser|pg||
nt|KingCur: yes agree|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  me too Ronny, good point|pg||
nt|KingCur: ah yes, Kx in W, not K bare, sorry bout that|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: A bit hard none vul game, I often tend to bid more carefully when none vul, since you dont gain that much vs a partscore |pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|h7|nt|KingCur: 2 off now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|KingCur: and another 5 to the Dutch|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 170 vs 420 is only 6 IMPs if you go down on 2 out of 3, you loose in the long run|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  depends players attitude my friend, you know sometimes players like to play conservative and prefer to earn IMPs slowly, but some like winner takes all, so they get risks and play aggressively|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: small @c and he goes only 1 off|pg||
nt|KingCur: yes|pg||
mc|9|nt|KingCur: was right on the imp count, though :)|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  nice try guys, here we agreed abt that 4@h was worth to try|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: hehe :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: 16 count and know partner have a limit hand with 4@h's, fair try|pg||
nt|KingCur: yes, especially with W's cards behind S's opener|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: and given the singleton @s in dummy, it looked good from east point of view. Declarer holding AQ in @s behind opening hand, dident look to bad either|pg||
nt|KingCur: so, impartially one must admit this was a tad unlucky for the brits|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: indeed|pg||

nt|KingCur: so, first two imps for the Brits|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  thats another point Ronny, but on the other hand an aggressive partner who has some extras, I mean cover cards at side suits may push to 4@s|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  I mean over 3@s|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: true, then we are back to "style" :)|pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  110 % agreed |pg||
nt|H_Karluk:  :)|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: get a lot of questions on why 4@s wasent dbled and why north dident make a dbl here|pg||
nt|KingCur: we will be seeing three stanzas tomorrow, starting at 9.45am, and the final two are played on sunday|pg||
nt|KingCur: me too|pg||
nt|STRIK3R: The point is, they do open light, and to be pushy and make a dbl of 4@s could be to expensive|pg||
