mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Another Norwegian pairs N-S. Norway has done extremely well with seven pairs in the final (among 46). No other country has this many.|pg||
nt|iceking: 2@S seems like Tartan Two opening |pg||
nt|vankan:  Looks like 6@c NS|pg||
nt|pelu:  if 2@S = @s + minor then NS has a chance to bid 6@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|iceking: 2nt ask now maybe 3@H respond to show max with @C |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu:  I am told - min 5-4|pg||
nt|vankan:  That right sides the contract, now to find out about the @d control|pg||
nt|iceking: 4@C looks straight forward|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sure, if it is forcing.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|iceking: long pause and 3@D not sure iam big fan of that|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|iceking: we dont know the true tempo though could always be some lag|pg||
mb|p|nt|vankan:  And apparently 3@d not alerted?|pg||
nt|iceking: we obvious have no idea what these bids mean|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu:  and NS dont have either :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bakke was not sure that 4@C was forcing. That is the crux of the matter I think.|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C would have been very good (as the cards are) :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|suketbombi: hope he spares his @SQ:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceking: 4@C could also have been some kind of RKCB and that doesnt help him much|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SQ did no harm.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|c2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceking: when you play Tartan you can use 3@D over 2@S as @S support that solves some problems|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: but if zia leads @S not too bad|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|vankan:  That is one way to miss your 4-4 @s fit|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont like it,, thought behind it i have weak @S and i want to decl 3nt with my @H holding i assume|pg||
nt|pelu:  if EW play 4. best - then S know that Ehas a singleton H in @s and sh take @sA|pg||
nt|bobholl: and 3nt migth compare good to 4@S|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|iceking: as one kib pointed out seems more like tilt from last hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bobholl: put up J i suppose|pg||
nt|iceking: these 2 boards probably close to 100% for Zia and Jansma|pg||
pc|h3|nt|iceking: normal biddding would have been 1@D-1@S-2@S-2nt-4@C-4@S at least in my world|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pelu:  det burdfe vel vÃ¦re let at stikke med @sA og spille @c??|pg||
nt|bobholl: most probably @C finesse and than @H play|pg||
mc|5|nt|pelu:  sorry privat: it sh not be so difficult to take @sA and plsy @c|pg||
nt|iceking: -3 or 4 will probably not matter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: T21 next if you want to follow Jansma-Zia.|pg||
nt|vankan:  If it was tilt, as a spec suggested I have to say you would not expect this at this level|pg||
nt|vankan:  That is one of the biggest traps: to follow a disaster by yet another one|pg||
nt|pelu:  Hoyland - Bakke was No 14 - before this 2 boards|pg||
