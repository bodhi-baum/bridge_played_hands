mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|BroLucius:  I have not been watching much of this pairs. Have they provided a link to some barometer scores table?|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Usually, with a 10-count, South would be strong to cue-bid 2@C to show a sound raise to at least the two-level. Here he has a very poor 10-count with a myriad of losers.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|BroLucius:  Although we see the correct pair names on our screens, a technical problem prevents them from being saved in the VuGraph records, as you will see if you go to these records later.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Obvious what to do at Trick 1, but of course Carrol stops to plan the whole play. |pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|sverjohn: upside down att.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|BroLucius:  Perhaps he leads low, rather than playing the ace first, to give North an easy exit in clubs.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Declarer has 8 tricks in the minors and clears his 9th trick in spades.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  A risk that the defenders may take three heart tricks but he cannot avoid that.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|BroLucius:  Of course he must cash the 13th club while in dummy for the last time (possibly)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dJ|nt|sverjohn: Lead looked disasterous but declarer should come to 9 tricks going after the hearts|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  North worried about strip squeeze.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  He has to throw @HA|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  North has not found the defence. Will Carrol benefit from it?|pg||
nt|sverjohn: does not help to discard the ace|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  South can then win @HK and lead a spade through|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|h6|pc|s3|pg||
mc|9|nt|BroLucius:  I see. He can endplay South instead. Well, that's neat.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Interesting position.|pg||
nt|sverjohn: South discarded the 8 and 6 of spades. Could indicate heart honour and help north|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  With only 14 opposite 10, there may be several pairs not in game. So, declarer would not take a risk of going down, seeking an uncertain overtrick.|pg||

He can be well pleased to reach the final and be in 21st position.  A lot of big names in his wake.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|BroLucius:  Some Norths would double with the unexpected trump tricks. Whether that is a good idea, it is hard to say. Sometimes goes wrong when opponents have a spot to run to.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|BroLucius:  Seems that 3NT would have been better - particularly with this heart break. The foreseen diamond ruff does not materialize in hearts, but declarer can ruff a club instead.|pg||
