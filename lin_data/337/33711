mb|1D!|an|2+|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 10-15, 2+@D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Diamond had seating rights, not surprisingly, they line up the same way|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 5@S 4/5@H, less than invite|pg||
nt|barnets: that explains it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|barnets: as e/w had a great set last time|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm not sure they had the seed - I think they had something like 1,2,4,5 - looked weird to me|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kareno: 2@h weak with both majors|pg||

nt|ahollan1: long serious of articles in Bridge World in early/mid 1980s  then a booklet|pg||
nt|kareno: Bathurst might play the king - it's easier to lead from an ace of trumps than from a queen.	In any event club shift will scuttle this.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: would RDBL be strong or the first transfer??|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bathurst "How were the @s's"|pg||
mb|1D!|an|2+|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D = 10-15, 2+@D|pg||
nt|sixela: if not strong, system needs revision|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H = bal, 11-13|pg||
nt|sixela: going to be tough to avoid slam, but unlikely to be any easier in the other room|pg||
nt|barnets: the trick is to stay out of slam here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing that 2@C could be  2+@C BAL FG|pg||
nt|kareno: Looks like 3nt unless they get ambitious in clubs|pg||
nt|passell: maybe 4nt  lowest possible stop|pg||
nt|sixela: with 20 opposite an opener, tough to dismiss 6nt as a poossibility|pg||
nt|ritong: if they stop in 3NT with 20 facing an opening, i eat a rat:)|pg||
nt|passell: best medium rare|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  2@H = 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Room here is deadly quiet|pg||
nt|sixela: i suspect their sys allows them to find out about some suit lengths, which will not work well here|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  For all the NICKELL crowd, we have lively boards here at the end of the match for sure|pg||
nt|kareno: From Bart Bramley a great play analyst: this club suit is intriguing - when 9 drops i think percentage is to play for Q9, next best is deep finesse, last choice is to play for 109 ...|pg||
nt|kareno: dbltn|pg||
nt|passell: Bathurst may like his hand over 4nt a non minimum plus a club fit|pg||
nt|barnets: Greco finally went down just 1 in4@SX|pg||
nt|sixela: 2h showed a balanced min, moss may just blast and hope the opening lead helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't recall every seeing definitions of follow-ups to the 2@H rebid|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|chip:  20 opposite 11 with now spots and 3 jacks is pretty pushy to drive to slam.|pg||
nt|ritong: phew|pg||
nt|barnets: so the lead is just 17 and Nickell have a good result on 57|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ooo    i HAVE seen   1N-4@S as quantitative  44 minors|pg||
nt|olien: with partners that I play with, I play that 2@s is a puppet to 2NT for various hands, 2NT is a GF 1-suiter, otherwise natural|pg||
nt|olien: thought that was a fairly common treatment here, guess not|pg||
nt|sixela: what onearth is 4S? looks like kc for something or maybe a strong slam try with 4nt being weaker|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  I was just about to ask, Sixela :)|pg||
nt|barnets: if you can pick the whole club suit|pg||
nt|barnets: and ko the @SA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bathurst deeply thinking . . . |pg||
nt|barnets: north is squeezed in the pointeds|pg||
nt|chip:  EW are not a regular partnership. This may not be at all clear to E.|pg||
nt|barnets: for the 12th trick|pg||
nt|chip:  Is that after declarer picks up the clubs for 4 tricks?|pg||
nt|barnets: north would have to duck 2 spades then get thrown in in the nd game|pg||
mb|5N|nt|barnets: to lead from @DQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Pick a slam?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, it was in preliminaries  however declarer would not have @h count, so would at best be squeeze vs @d hook imo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when it doubt   5N = i'm in doubt -- you pick|pg||
nt|medwards: Test|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bathurst indicates to Meck that he's not sure what 5@s meant|pg||
mb|6D!|mb|p|nt|kareno: What an auction for a new partnership to encounter at this juncture|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe West should not have tried 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D is baffling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually  maybe not|pg||
nt|chip:  perhaps W assumed E would pick clubs with 4 and could have 4D.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Sorry, Bathurst unsure of 4@s bid, misclick earlier :)|pg||
nt|schwartzy:  brad meant 4s this as a 4nt bid with 4-4 minors|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:  heart lead best, spade may give up a trick in Meck plays the ace.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  57  Weinstein DID start with RDBL |pg||
nt|ritong: talk about high pressure hand|pg||
nt|chip:  I suppose a club is really best, but he won't lead that.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sixela: this can be made on any lead with the right guesses|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss "Good luck"|pg||
nt|barnets: he just has to take 4 club tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: then walk on water|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well 3 of us have reported that -- it can't possibly be true|pg||
nt|chip:  now can't make if Rodwell covers the club 8 on the second round.|pg||
nt|olien: so 3 rights do make a wrong?|pg||
nt|barnets: so If Nickel will have lead if slam goes down and they stay out on 58 in closed|pg||

mb|1C|nt|lrobb98:  After an opening by E, it is tuff for W to stay out of slam here.....|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|an|inverted|mb|p|nt|jkdood: The lead and right-siding it may make a significant difference in NT|pg||
mb|3C!|an|minimum|mb|p|nt|sixela: if they use rkc, they will stay out of 6cc, but might bid 6nt anyway|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  some play that, if E bids some NT, 4NT is a regular inv, and depending on system, 5 spades is great invite...that would work here, if E bids 3NT at some point.....E can then sign off....|pg||
nt|drewsky: I find it very hard to believe that west with 20 HCP will stay out of slam|pg||
nt|passell: if he key cards and finds out off queen and an ace|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6N by West with a @D lead looks far from hopeless|pg||

mb|4D!|an|RKC for !c|nt|passell: a diamond lead looks foolish  normal heart lead|pg||

mb|1N|nt|barnets: so 58 likely decides who wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Possible small swing on choice of denomination|pg||
nt|chip:  This hower looks flat, though maybe 2 imps if 6D and 6N.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6N or some form of science?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: science could help if 7@d is cold|pg||
nt|olien: Levin and Weinstein bidding the failed slam hand|pg||
nt|olien: will probably go 1NT-2NT puppet stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: brutality could help if 6NT is in danger|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Owen & I get style points|pg||
nt|olien: and then I believe after north denies, S can bid 4@d showing 5@d(332) and slam interest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = modified Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|3C!|an|Likes !d's|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D = 5@D(332)   i think|pg||
nt|barnets: in closed 1@C -2@C -3@C start|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|olien: I believe for them 3@c shows a super minimum opener and over that, west may settle for 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|olien: after 1@c-2@c // 3@c|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|barnets: 4@D RKC|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Rodwell contemplating|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H = RCK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RKC|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in @D|pg||
nt|chip:  That might cost them 2 imps, which could be costly (lose 2 won't, but failing to win 2 could).|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|barnets: weinstein considering bidding slam over 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|olien: after finding out that they're missing 1 keycard and the @cQ|pg||
nt|barnets: partner showed one Key and no Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C fits into 4@H being RKC @D    showing 2, no Q|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous! extraordinary scenario as so often  can t wait and will run next room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks everyone, done here after the lead :)|pg||
nt|barnets: he passed 5@C|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks all |pg||
nt|olien: now just to make it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right  58	where 6N-2   levin-weinstein stop in 5@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meck "You showed 5-3-3-2 Eric""Yes with good hand"|pg||
nt|kareno: We know they stopped in 5@c.|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like another Nickell comeback|pg||
nt|ganz:  wow what a finish|pg||
