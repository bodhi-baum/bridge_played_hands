nt|ahollan1: thanks JoAnna  i was just typing that|pg||
nt|barnets: not so clear how to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2N was stayman -- and 3@C was a response in corresponding major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: We have a superstar cast of Commentators, to many laurels and knowledge present to list! :)|pg||

nt|passell: with 3 small spades he may well lead it|pg||

nt|passell: yes|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  Continuing the theme of "3NT is often right when 4 of the major goes down, or can go down".....|pg||
nt|passell: 3nt interesting after the heart lead then ace and a dia shift declarer would have to guess well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Levin's right hand is in a cast, so he's using a card holder for his cards and doesn't sort them (worried that it would be obvious where he was playing a card from). Hampson nicely ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: which round suit do you lead?|pg||

nt|jumpshift:  yesterday there was a situation where a member of the Diamond team had an opportunity to make a lead directing double of 5@D,  didn't and they scored up the slam on a different lead|pg||
nt|kareno: Club has three in a row - as Edgar Kaplan said, those suits talk to you.|pg||

nt|ritong: it does not really matter  the idea is to have a reason, whatever its size, rather than a pure coinflip|pg||
nt|kareno: Henri, sometimes it is truly a coinflip and we have to accept that|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|kareno: So you can decide for yourself that for your entire bridge life you will play the king in this situation and at least half the time you will be right|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, there's always 'play the one you hate the most for the card you need'|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  if Rodwell pitches a heart, declarer will get it right because the QJ9xx of hearts will be revealed, and with diamond ace, may have overcalled 1@H|pg||

nt|dburn: using your skill and judgement, rearrange those into a well-known phrase or saying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: And now Greco wrote something that also included "I think" and keycard for diamonds (I think). Both notes had some other stuff that I can't read|pg||
nt|jkdood: Moss guessed @D in 6@S on Bd 42 for a push|pg||
nt|dburn: getting even harder to make a living|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Hampson is writing a bunch ore and I just can't see it - hope they'll say at the end|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn: four keycards, amybe, but Hampson may have to guess which four|pg||
mb|5C|nt|robinswr: this doesn't sound right|pg||
nt|dburn: it looks a bit odd for a void to use keycard, certainly|pg||
nt|drewsky: If 4@C was keycard for diamonds, why wouldn't 5@C be exclusion KC for diamonds ?|pg||
nt|drewsky: Directly over 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OK - now I have Hampson's note - I had it all wrong. It does have I think, but then says 2@s = 5+ @hs, 2NT = NAT, 4@c Just Invented|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Hampson intended 4@c as that - 4@d would do as ordinary keycard|pg||
nt|passell: 4clubs splinter for dia 5cl void|pg||

mb|d|nt|drewsky: thanks mike|pg||
nt|dburn: well, no one as a practical matter would bid a grand on a murky auction such as this - I hope...|pg||
