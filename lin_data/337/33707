nt|kit: hi Joanna|pg||
nt|kit: Defending 4@H, I imagine Weinstein would have gone up ace.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kareno: A partscore hand - |pg||
nt|ritong: welcome to the club, bobby|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jumpshift:  That Seniors is getting to be a killer event:  Meckwell played in it last fall|pg||
nt|kit: this doesn't seem necessary -- if partner isn't bidding game over a 3@H call, I doubt if you want to be there.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: Hard to imagine the teenager I knew already a 'senior.'  But aren't they raising the age requirement?	55 seems so silly|pg||
nt|kit: Still, it is going to be close|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kareno: Well it WAS a partscore hand.  He can work out that diamond suit and do very well.|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer can lead a club off dummy, but won't be able to both ruff a heart and enjoy the extra club trick|pg||
nt|kit: Platnick has pretty easy trump shift it looks like|pg||
nt|kit: The 7 of hearts lead warns him that his partner has nothing in hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: he might look for a @d ruff though|pg||
nt|ritong: engaged, but..|pg||
nt|kareno: That's certainly a possibility, Henri.  Depends which ace his partner holds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|kit: he doesn't need a diamond ruff if his partner has ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: Also true.|pg||
nt|kit: Diamond may need to shift to a club when in, as otherwise declarer can set up the diamond suit.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jtmckee: then he can throw diamonds on clubs|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  Platnick might have led the @S9 (followed by @S10 ) to suggest shift to lower|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Welcome Jay McKee, east coast expert and fine commentator :)|pg||
nt|kit: Not so sure about winning ace of spades -- although if he had ducked, declarer could set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: So maybe right play, provided he finds the club shift|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|kit: Nicely done|pg||
nt|kareno: But the club shift eliminates the diamond loser, Kit|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- he needs to ruff a heart in dummy, so can't enjoy the club|pg||
nt|kareno: I see - has to draw the trumps to run the clubs and a heart will be lost|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Jay McKee is from the deep south, my mistake, and a star in that area :)|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  Platnick can't tell the @C10 is third, creates a problem|pg||
nt|ritong: also, he might foresee some unpleasant ending|pg||
nt|kareno: No endplay - that would be a fourth defensive trick.|pg||
nt|kit: Platnick needs to work this position out -- I think he should.|pg||
nt|kit: He can't legitimately beat the hand if declarer has 3 clubs and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|kareno: And no squeeze- no entry to the diamond threat|pg||
nt|kit: If he goes up king, declarer does best to drop jack and make club return unattractive|pg||
nt|kareno: Folks, you are all telling me what has already been said here.  Can't reply to those comments, sorry|pg||
nt|kit: But what happens if he returns a trump, and instead of ruffing a heart in dummy declarer runs all the trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Is East in some kind of progressive squeeze?|pg||
nt|ritong: that was my suggestion|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so, but need to work it out|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kit: However, I can't see declarer doing that|pg||
nt|kareno: A nonmaterial squeeze where he cannot pitch a club because that allows an overtake|pg||
nt|ritong: gib says the ottlik position does not work  i shamelessly checked|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Platnick obviously very, very deep in thought, folds and unfolds hand|pg||
nt|kit: Question is whether Diamond should have returned a small club.	He probably should have, but position is not obvious at all.|pg||
nt|kareno: They're talking about a trump return so club return is not in this discussion.  Folks, please, try to follow the discussion online|pg||
nt|ritong: kit suggested to drop the @cJ to deter a @c continuation|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ritong: well|pg||
nt|ritong: now there s damage done|pg||
nt|kareno: Platnick still studying whether to take the club... now that allows declarer to guess out the diamonds.|pg||
nt|kit: Platnick believed the 10 of clubs play -- perhaps playing declarer for 5-4-1-3 shape|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wein "Anything funny about your @h raise after my overcall?" Diamond "nothing funny, just normal"|pg||
nt|kit: Now all declarer has to do is get the diamonds right, which he figures to do.|pg||

nt|kareno: Checking distribution|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|kit: he didn't think of it.|pg||
nt|ritong: it would not be useful|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wein asking more about the @h raise|pg||
nt|kit: you are right -- it wouldn't have helped|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess not|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  the e-w system is such that E would have an opening bid if his @DK were the jack|pg||
nt|kit: but it looks like a neat play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Mixed raise was available - 3@d|pg||
nt|ritong: yes	ars gratia artis as they say|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  109, AQxxx, Jx, K9xx|pg||
nt|kareno: :) Henri|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  so declarer needs to look at what raises were available to west:  if 3@H mixed then will get it right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Wein "You open most 10's" Diamond "11's mostly, 10's depends"|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will just plain get it right -- if East doesn't have king of diamonds, he could easily ahve beaten controact by winning king of clubs|pg||
nt|kit: That is the key clue|pg||

nt|kareno: Tough game |pg||
nt|jumpshift:  very tough hand to defend:  lots of ways for defense to go wrong|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: Platnick will probably show majors, assuming he has bid to do that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: East has the right shape to get in but a lot of losers|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  huh?  feels like putting your head on the chopping block, vul vs not, with such poor suits Kit|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  sorry,	I was looking at diamond|pg||
mb|d!|an|Meckwell|nt|ritong: kit is totally fearless|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  Platnick has a clear bid|pg||
nt|kit: well, assuming partner has a balanced 10-count or so, would you rather contract for 7 tricks in notrump or 8 tricks in your best major?|pg||
nt|kareno: Vulnerability is for children :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|jumpshift:  totally agree Kit,  I was dyslexic about who was Platnick and who was Diamond|pg||
nt|kit: After all, defending 1NT is same as declaring 1NT -- you need to take 7 tricks.|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure most of us would compete.  Nothing in the minors, not even a jack|pg||
mb|d!|an|Negative|nt|kit: And now the bidding will soon get to the 3-level, and the major suit will win the battle|pg||
nt|ritong: balancing is super obvious  for starters you can have a vul game|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  the likely 3@H contract will depend on guessing the @SJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Levin sighing, asking questions of Platnick, discussion on other side of screen also|pg||
nt|kit: For those of you who are afraid of going for a number with the East hand, that is going to happen at most 1 time in 10 I would estimate|pg||
nt|kareno: How many clubs?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|kit: And if that happens, it costs only maybe 8 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Weinstein chuckles|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  or not:	declarer may get the diamonds set up for pitches, but not relevant now|pg||
nt|kit: While bidding gains perhaps 3 or 4 times in 10|pg||
nt|kareno: North a believer.|pg||
nt|kit: this is advance save against a game opponents haven't bid yet -- I don't like it.|pg||
nt|ritong: it s not likely, but perhaps 5@c is a make|pg||
nt|kit: This can be doubled on general principles, when you onsider the pass of 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Levin-Platnick are "screenmates" as are Weinstein-Diamond|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  Diamond needs to stay off the diamond lead|pg||
nt|kit: There is no hand where Levin is going to pass 1NT and now 5@C is likely to make|pg||
nt|ritong: that one is imo|pg||
nt|ritong: just a jack close to|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: LEvin "Trying to get them to bid"|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: He isn't leading a diamond on this auction.|pg||
nt|kareno: It's an eyelash away from making.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will just try the diamonds and go down 1 quietly|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  on non-spade lead, declarer just needs diamonds 3-3 or singleton/doubleton quack with east|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: that s for a start, and opener may have a good @d J in supplement  5@c is not a total daydream i think|pg||
nt|kit: I still think West should have doubled -- on this auction, down 2 is more likely than making IMO, and down 1 is most likely|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't like the trump lead for that reason.  What if south had the spade ace and north the AT9x of diamonds?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kit: And if they happen to make, it is only 4 IMP cost -- and that is assuming same contact at other table which is very unlikely|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
