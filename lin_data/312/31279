nt|marlowepi:  an easy choice in a forcing club system, and pretty easy when NV regardless, but advisable under any curcumstances in my view|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  however we must note the downside|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  one of the hands we should most fear is a strong NT with S. and if S does have that, we are probably better off passing|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  it is hard to fault the weak 2 bid, though we should note that: (a)	6322 shape is as bad as you can have with a 6-card suit    (b)	spades dont usually get lost	(c) if we are to play in spades it is highly probable we want partner to declare|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi:  factor (c) is one of the many advantages of multi|pg||

mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:	this 6322 junkpile is worse still|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  3H a trifle conservative but 4H is a pretty big bid, and X is very dangerous|pg||
mb|3N|nt|gsper:  6@H should make, but is not very good SD, especially after the preempt.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  this 3N calls unduly regressive|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  but is influenced by the fact that W has only bid 3H and even that may have been under pressure|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  E knows W is short in clubs and thus may have stretched a bit for 3H because she couldnt count on E to protect if he had some heart length|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi:  W could have bid 4C here, but she also feared a stretch by E at the colors, and/or bad breaks, plus if there is a slam the prempt might have already made it too hard to bid. but surely 3N is not last making game|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  this W is famous for hair-trigger calling director ,,,  hopefully E bid in tempo (or his 5C bid promised 2+ contriolled suits) or he could perhaops have been hoist on his own petard|pg||

nt|marlowepi:  the only way N can help on the defense is with a ruff|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: now he has to play @H to K or it's curtains|pg||
nt|BSpiljak: and most declarers hate to go down @@ trick 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  it is a longshot but there is rarely a future in leading a long weak suit against a game or higher suit contract|pg||
