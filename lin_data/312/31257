nt|viren169: was close to 2@S on the earlier round|pg||
nt|thegarve: Having played and discussed methods in the car/bar with King and Small, I should have some insight into what they do; had my first outing with Allerton too and have discussed ...|pg||
nt|thegarve: plenty with Jeffrey|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|nt|thegarve: Jagger loves his weak no trump, so they are one of the few pairs to play that range throughout - a different NT range causes a lot of swings|pg||

nt|thegarve: Allfrey 255.99, Fegarty 208.18, Hinden 208.15, Small 206.79 and Penfold 201.60. With Penfold playing Allfrey, unless the winners have cracked open the beers, I would expect them ...|pg||
nt|thegarve: not to figure on the rostrum. With Hinden playing Small and Fegarty , knocking each other down, the gap has opened up for Fegarty to come second|pg||
nt|thegarve: Fearty is playing Mossop|pg||
nt|viren169: 2nd 3rd 4th are very close|pg||
