mb|1N|mb|p|nt|danilo1: :)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  If South goes into clubs, this may make it easier for West to compete.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|BroLucius:  That looks wild to me.|pg||
nt|danilo1: nice hand for 4-way tr .. Suth just bid 2@S and .. over 2NT-3NT, over 3@C pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: can be honour J 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: the lead|pg||
nt|danilo1: why agressive lead with no entry .. having clear natural @S lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: denies J 10|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Spade lead would have hit the spot.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  Very lucky position of the cards. @CA in the safe hand that cannot attack spades through the king.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|danilo1: or lucky .. now ... since South not dangerous hand, Barbos may well find @HK now|pg||

mb|3C|nt|BroLucius:  Oh not this time. Karen, who is at the table, tells us 'strength'.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: Eyde said so|pg||

mb|2N|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|3D|nt|BroLucius:  Yes, slightly risky to bid and just as risky to pass.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: it was impossible for North to stop below 4@H (esp. when he could see @C singleton) ... but this is not excuse for 3@S|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  3@H would be poor now, with only 8 trumps.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: sorry, corrected score other table this board|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|danilo1: after they passed 2@H, maybe West should decide to pass 3@C ... once he doubled it, he should double 3@D as well|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  A bit risky to double 3@D, isn't it? Better to pass 3@C. |pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@C pass at this voulberabilty wase wise bid ... needed to control emotions :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|BroLucius:  One spade two aces and a club ruff will beat it. Must get the spade trick in time.|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|danilo1: but however, Nort's 3@C choice should not be psyche (at this voulnerability) ... so Dble on 3@D is sound I think|pg||

nt|danilo1: lucky stop in 3@C at the other table ... on normal @C/@S split, 5@C in on|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Yes, 5@C an excellent game but the spade break is hostile.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  3@C is bit low. Surely 4@C better.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  But West's double warns of bad breaks.|pg||
nt|danilo1: actually, as South, I would risk 3NT (not ask 3@D since if pd Kxx, 3NT would be played from wrong side)|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Does North have enough to bid again?|pg||
nt|danilo1: 3@C is free bid, still I thik slight underbid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|BroLucius:  Probably well judged all round.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|danilo1: but since 1NT forcing, 3@C should be invitational bid anyway ... so maybe North should take action|pg||

pc|dK|nt|BroLucius:  Why is 3@C invitational? What is he meant to do with a weak hand and long clubs?|pg||
mc|10|nt|danilo1: ir 2 over 1, that sequence 1NT followed by 3@C shows invitational values |pg||
nt|vugraphzbh: 1NT was already NF|pg||
