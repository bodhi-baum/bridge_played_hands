nt|SchTsch:  to score the @s9|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal or 17+ bal|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  it is true N has no shortness and a HCP minimum, but S showed INV+, and when our suit is spades we typically have a lot of time, and when foe are at unfavorable that is exponentially more true. maybe N could have gone slower with AK + Axxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  just in case S had a really good hand but would be boxed over the preemptive 4S|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = artifical game force   a few hand types|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|Henryb:	depends, doesn't it, how often partner upgrades to a strong club on shape?|pg||

nt|Henryb:  It doesn't seem terribly important which hand is known when you are top heavy in high cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes several specs said same to me privately|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  more effective if playing against Scotland of course|pg||
mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 4@H is RKC[1430] in @D   but not postive|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  (9 of diamonds is traditionally known as the "Curse of Scotland")|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S is consistent with that interpretation|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Of course you'll get strip squeezed anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so vanProoijen knows missing either @DK or @HA|pg||
nt|Henryb:  even if you drop the @d9 under the ace|pg||
nt|Henryb:  But the dummy in 6N will be @dK10xx|pg||
