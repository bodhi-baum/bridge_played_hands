nt|Fluffy: dutch pair plying an inferior 6NT where 7@h is cold, the lead blocked her and if she plays an inferior line she might even go down|pg||
nt|pef: four spades looks normal and then north has a problem.	alost surely will bid 5 hearts which fails by a trick|pg||
nt|Fluffy: I am tlaking aobut the other table|pg||
nt|newmoon: needs a @C lead to give 4@S a chance|pg||
nt|newmoon: others lead to -1 |pg||
nt|dbl me:  You love having 4 d's...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pef: of course over 5h west might bid 5 spades--hard to guess exactly where this will end up. |pg||
nt|pef: hmm true to the conservative principles, I guess|pg||
nt|dbl me:  If 3, then surely 4, no?|pg||
nt|pef: but with 8 spades and four cards in partner's suit...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|pef: maybe holding something in reserve for when they bid 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|Fluffy: Wolpert has to decide between 4@h or 4@d, I think she is worth 4@d being a passed hand|pg||
nt|dbl me:  3 is def. threading the needle...unjustifiably with 4 d's|pg||
nt|pef: if the american's get a swing here in their favor. from what we're hearing, the final board may tell the tale|pg||
nt|dbl me:  N shd be trying to figure out what to do a level higher.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Fluffy: East has a good missfitting hand, on this position best for double vs pass is one of them to ask partner to shut up an dthe other encourage bidding on|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  right time for 5@d bid|pg||
mb|5D|nt|SFoxa:  and the problem is passed to N|pg||
mb|d|nt|Fluffy: not much of a problem with 2 aces|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@s would have created a bidgger problem for N|pg||

nt|dbl me:  absolutely|pg||
nt|ady: this can be 9 imps to USA|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: or more|pg||
nt|pef: why would you want to play one level higher?|pg||
nt|Fluffy: I would think that with that hand you make more tricks in spades than diamonds most of the time, and it is a level lower!|pg||
nt|newmoon: rdbles - at this level - at this juncture?	   wow|pg||
nt|Fluffy: if you get tap you might score zero spade tricks|pg||
nt|dbl me:  It's the same, as in spades, opps get a d ruff.|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  hoping ti hear 5@h from opps?|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  *to|pg||
nt|newmoon: N thinking S void in East?|pg||
nt|pef: more poker than bridge here|pg||
nt|newmoon: E void, not S|pg||
nt|dbl me:  E can tell that a xx won't lead to a 5H bid.|pg||
nt|pelu:  Rd = change -3 IMP to -7|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib:  East getting passive and active at the wrong moments :(|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Well, N is thinking about it, but shd not be.|pg||
nt|pef: well it's keeping me up well past my bedtime|pg||
nt|newmoon: kib:  in the transnationals the polish player went for 1100 in 5 hearts and kicked his team out of the semifinals|pg||
nt|dbl me:  If S chooses not to bid on, it shdn't be close for N.|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  may I offer you a mug of coffee, Peter :)|pg||
nt|pef: iced tea would be better|pg||
nt|pelu:  for sure - tx - and a lot of sugar|pg||

nt|bobholl: @H = @S|pg||
nt|pelu:  :) hvad skulle det ellers betyde :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 6@S   bit worse than heart finesse|pg||
nt|Fluffy: on BB USA1 bid up to 6@s but they were desperate for a swing|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes and if they bid it usa in the lead|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|dbl me:  Great time for a PJR with a bal. hand...|pg||
nt|bobholl: but 1@H doesn't garantuee 5@S:(|pg||
mb|4D|nt|bobholl: may be this even is a support double|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  does dbl promise 3 cards support?|pg||
nt|Fluffy: NS bid will make Wortel suspect his @dA is not at full value|pg||
nt|newmoon: then dble = support x with 3|pg||
nt|pef: she does fine to pass the double here.	n/s lose 3 clubs, two hearts, and two diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|pef: but that's hard with a 65 hand|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@D cue dont get Es hand better|pg||
nt|pelu:  5@d by S will not gain IMPs|pg||
nt|dbl me:  W shd conclude at this point that she has done enuf|pg||
nt|mwigor:  not impossible they will reach 6@s here - and its not a dreadful contract - just needs a finesse through the overcaller|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  does S consider 5@d sacrificing?|pg||
nt|bobholl: michielsen still thinking about going on ? hope not|pg||
nt|bobholl: ew were already unlucky on 1st board |pg||
nt|SFoxa:  if N's jump bid is based on non-balanced hand - why not? |pg||
nt|bobholl: sry the unlucky board was in previous session :)|pg||
nt|dbl me:  She's also taking long enuf potentially to bar her pd, which may push her to bid|pg||
nt|pef: both of the next two boards have considerable swing potential|pg||
mb|p|nt|bebechira: 4000 spectators..thats fantastic :)|pg||
mb|6S|nt|pef: wow|pg||
nt|bobholl: there go the dutch chances :(|pg||
nt|pef: yes, that's likely to be the match|pg||
nt|Fluffy: is 1@c strong?|pg||
nt|newmoon: live web feed:  http://new.livestream.com/accounts/5339416/WBTC-Bali|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobholl: 1 @C is standard|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 11-20 2+ @C|pg||
nt|dbl me:  I can see showing the hA, but not jumping to slam.|pg||
nt|newmoon: is East thinking?|pg||
nt|bobholl: again a redouble ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|SFoxa:	hoping to find partner with @hK or @h short|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fluffy: no, operator is being disciplinate and putting bids when the tray passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fluffy: south was thinking|pg||
nt|newmoon: in video feed, East asking lots of questions from S|pg||
nt|newmoon: to|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|pef: so 11 imps to the USA here and back up by 4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|newmoon: East asking N, yes|pg||
nt|newmoon: same side of screen|pg||
nt|Fluffy: 31 board is a potential swing for both sides, but 500 is really unlikely|pg||
nt|newmoon: got my mixed all facts up|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pef: don't need 500.  dutch will need to gain 4 imps by my calculations to make the last board relevant|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Is N considering ducking?...nah.|pg||
nt|bobholl: got already 7 messages from (also) nervous dutch supporters|pg||
nt|Fluffy: yeah but since their score will be provided by downs and 2 down is the most I Can think of it will be bneeded to be doubled|pg||
nt|Fluffy: but lets see|pg||
nt|Fluffy: on last board even going down is possible|pg||
nt|Fluffy: not sure to which contract but you never know|pg||
nt|Fluffy: but back to this hand, I find it amazing that Wortel didn't try to manage a heart ruff before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Fluffy: she is a trick short now even if @hK is onside isn't her?|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes should have tried @H finesse first but the difference is null|pg||
nt|dbl me:  She may be rattled, knowing N must have the hK|pg||
nt|bobholl: i have lost almost all hope 31 and 32 are not very good for the netherlands|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  but we saw a lot of moves far from obvious or reasonable|pg||
nt|SFoxa:  if one has 10 days of exhausting play behind, each tool works|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|SFoxa:  playing technics, stamina, psychology of the winning|pg||

nt|bobholl: still has to guess but the critical fase has passed|pg||
nt|athene: yes, can't go down now|pg||
