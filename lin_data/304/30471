mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|athene: the only time that loses, i suppose, is when east has stiff @CA and the @SQ|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: which is negligible|pg||
pc|cT|nt|JaapFr: or @CJT sec|pg||
nt|vugraphzcb: last board to day..|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|JaapFr: indeed a lot of the greatest players do play fast|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|barnets: board 11 was push when helgemo down 1 in 4@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|barnets: Monaco gained 10 imps on board 10 when n/s played 3@S not 4 as here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Fluffy: I think @h9 might save the day|pg||
nt|Fluffy: for NS|pg||
nt|JaapFr: @H8 for W i would say|pg||
nt|athene: now there are throw-in threats against both defenders|pg||
nt|Fluffy: you mean endplay north? if he keep 4 hearts it doesn't work|pg||
nt|JaapFr: nah if play x@H now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: declarer lacks the entries to lead a small diamond from dummy and then untangle them|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|athene: but he can still prevail|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|JaapFr: now down|pg||
nt|athene: needed to use the @H10 as a throw-in threat though|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c4|nt|Fluffy: I see GIB says playing @h10 was a mistake, but I really don't see the difference|pg||
nt|athene: well you play low and south plays the jack and you win the ace|pg||
nt|Fluffy: in my eyes the contract was always down|pg||
nt|JaapFr: could end by throw in N|pg||
nt|JaapFr: when we have troubles DD can imagine how tough SD this board is|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|barnets: n/sbid 7N on 12 so flat|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
mc|7|nt|JaapFr: DD is seeing all cards and not only 26 SD Single dummy|pg||
nt|Fluffy: lol I checked double dummy, and it looks like defence gave it away 3 times and declarer went down 3 times|pg||
nt|JaapFr: DD double dummy|pg||
nt|JaapFr: enough Fluf±'|pg||
nt|barnets: tks all|pg||
nt|Fluffy: really tough hand|pg||
nt|JaapFr: tx all |pg||
nt|Fluffy: thanks all|pg||
nt|athene: the winning line at the end was very cute if he had read the cards|pg||
nt|athene: on the heart shift you save the 10 and win in hand|pg||
nt|Fluffy: oh fine my double dummy solver fails!|pg||
nt|athene: cash 3 spades - south has to throw a heart (if he throws a diamond you just duck one to establish the long diamonds)|pg||
nt|Fluffy: he says a card is winner and the next trick rechecks and is down|pg||
nt|Fluffy: just to see how hard this hand is|pg||
nt|athene: now you lead the @H10 and south has to cover and you DUCK (avoidance, keeping north out)|pg||
nt|athene: south must play another heart (his last) and you win and now run the @D10 to endplay him to lead into the @DA8|pg||
nt|athene: it's all about stripping south's exit cards without letting north in - that's why you need the @H10|pg||
