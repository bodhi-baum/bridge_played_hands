nt|fabsayc: what is the best line, assuming diamond continuation|pg||
nt|kit: This could be tricky hand -- declarer in priniple has 5 spades, 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and 1 diamond -- if he can lead from his hand often enough.|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Good technique keeping N on lead.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Seems going after trick 10 in clubs but not pulling trump in case 4-1 (pump) also|pg||
nt|kit: more just a matter of reducing the defensive options later in the hand.|pg||
nt|bradc: needs H finesse on, 3-2 spades....give up 2c and D|pg||
nt|jkdood: I think 4-1 spades can be handled if timed right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suggestion, spade to hand, then heart hook, if it wins draw trump and club towards jack|pg||
nt|kit: club to jack bad is South has Qx.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if it loses, try club hook|pg||
nt|bradc: not sure but seems like if S are 4-1 he needs to dbl dummy AQ in south hand|pg||
nt|bradc: clubs|pg||
nt|kit: I think he on diamond continuation he just rides jack of clubs, going down if North has AQxx but making on pretty much all other layouts.|pg||
nt|bradc: otherwise can just drive clubs and take H finesse|pg||
nt|jkdood: If trump are indeed 3-2, a sort of dummy reversal may also work|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|dbl me:  N can rule out cK with pd, in view of the d10|pg||

nt|kit: usa lead mounts, as on the 1100 hand they did bid slam, but in spades, not diamonds.|pg||
