nt|dannymiles:	Last year, I was fortunate enough to partner Korbel at the World Championship in Lille - he was nothing short of spectacular all week.|pg||

nt|bradc: has anyone looked up the history? was it the first playoff in Spingold history?|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	On this year's team, the Gartagani (one Gartaganis, two Gartagani) were our NPC and coach last year and did a phenominal job - it was clear Nick knows exactly what it takes to win at this level. |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Also on this year's team, Paul Thurston and Jeff Smith, who are perennial contenders in the Cdn championship, with multiple wins. They were oh so close in 2012, losing the semi-final by 1 imp. This year, their team rolled over everyone.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|chorush: diamond K would have had more interest. If Weinstein wins it the contract will make|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|dannymiles:  If either contract had made, Canada would have picked up 10 or 12|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|dannymiles:  NS had a precision auction in the closed room to 5@c.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dannymiles:  NS might get higher here|pg||
nt|kareno: 6@c not a bad contract but not tonight|pg||
nt|barnets: why its cold|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	6@c is not without play. Ruffing a heart in the South hand brings the total to 12|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Can score a heart ruff in dummy with club length in east.  We'll find out.|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	I think for a heart ruff, he has to commit to that line almost immediately on the likely spade lead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chorush: Mark Lair and I both think he will not make it|pg||
nt|dannymiles:	Spec points out playing for either red suit 3-3 or a squeeze is a better line...which fails|pg||
nt|kareno: I am on your side of this, Ira.  |pg||
nt|dannymiles:	EW bid to the 3-level with 10 combined HCP...Levin's spidey senses might be tingling that suits aren't breaking|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: He'll likely hope for a red suit squeeze or something like it.  |pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c9|nt|chorush: yes he is going for red suit squeeze or diamond break|pg||
nt|chorush: j9 or q9 or qJ doubleton or 3-3 diamonds or diamond heart squeeze or hearts 3-3 or doubleton 10x or Jx in East|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kareno: I doubted Korbel would unguard diamonds|pg||
