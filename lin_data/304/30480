nt|brgpro: Kibs asked me cant get a @s trick, but u can cash all winners then play 4th @d to S, he has to give @sK a trick|pg||
nt|granguru:  @CK perhaps?|pg||
nt|jkdood: I think covering J@D helped quite a bit|pg||
nt|kit: I think he will shift to a spade -- he is going to have to do so eventually anyway.|pg||
nt|kit: he pretty much had to cover -- declarer might not have had the 10.|pg||
nt|kit: Obviously if he knew declarer had the 10 he would have ducked the jack of diamonds.|pg||
nt|jkdood: But of course now its a simple sure entry, and looks like 3N done deal|pg||
nt|jkdood: Zia might say the J@D wouldnt have been played without the Ten|pg||
nt|brgpro: if declarer starts with a @d to the Q then small @c to the 9, he can make it maybe|pg||
nt|kit: On this auction it would|pg||
nt|brgpro: when in with @cJ, S has to play @dK from hand to get rid of the entry in dummy, and block the @c|pg||
nt|brgpro: but then declarer has 4 @d tricks|pg||
