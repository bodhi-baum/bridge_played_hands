pc|s3|nt|game over: lucky layout of all suits, declarer must discard one spade on diamonds first and can then play a club to the queen ( he needs clubs 3-2)|pg||

pc|h6|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Salokin:  at ther other table indonesia safed in 4@S which might lost 800 if NS found all there ruffs|pg||
nt|game over: he knows E/W points are fairly evenly divided and both did not make a move, although they have a nine-card fit|pg||
