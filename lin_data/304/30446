mb|5D|mb|p|nt|athene: some people may be wondering why Fantoni didn't open 2@S|pg||
mb|5S|nt|diana_eva:  Welcome Bill and Gonzalo|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i think they play that promises a "really" unbalanced hand i.e. 6+ spades or a singleton somewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana_eva:  gonzalo also known as bridgegod :P|pg||
nt|Fluffy: the difference between 4@c and 4@s is to let partner know that you bid 4@s to make because you have the values (for a passed hand), rather than just gamble that ti will make or be ...|pg||
nt|Fluffy: a good save (shapy raise)|pg||
nt|athene: 5422 is counted as (semi-)balanced so they would have to open that 1NT if they wanted to open it|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|Fluffy: Robson has evaluated his hand as offensive, because @cKQJx are worthles on defence as he anticipated|pg||

nt|Fluffy: ig spads were 4-1 and clubs 3-1 fantoni would be in big trouble, losing control of the hand if he is careless, that's why he is taking extra care|pg||
nt|athene: of course forrester is unlikely to have that for a "classic" 4@H bid but 63 imps down you don't bid classically|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|Fluffy: 2@h is probably a multiwa bid containing a constructive raise in spades (normaly with 3 cards on the variations I know)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|yorkbeach:  system card suggests it is natural and GF but maybe I am not reading it right|pg||
nt|athene: according to the EW convention card 2@H is natural and game-forcing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: but that is not really logical here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  whatever it means, it seems to have backfired|pg||
nt|athene: nunes wouldn't double it and forrester wouldn't bid 4@S :) i'm guessing it's a spade raise|pg||
nt|Fluffy: maybe they changed it a little? Robosn and Forrester have other partners on the team as well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes that might explain it - perhaps they are playing the Forrester-Gold card or the Robson-Allfrey card|pg||
nt|Fluffy: Nunes is thinking, his thinking goes along this lines: if there is a heart ruff I don't need it right now|pg||
nt|Fluffy: because I have spade ace|pg||
nt|Fluffy: his thinking is wrong at this point because @dA takes care of third heart|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer has @cAJ, might need to take it right now|pg||
nt|Fluffy: if partner has @hAxx wodl a switch work?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  or as William says declarer might throw a @h from hand on the @d|pg||
nt|Fluffy: that is what he is thinking, but I don't see a lie out where a switch is correct|pg||
nt|Fluffy: the only one owuld be partner having @cAxxxx as well as @hAQxx, then a low club switch would be neede|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  director is at table|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  perhaps they have the wrong CC card out|pg||
nt|athene: well, imagine if north had @HAxx and forrester @HQx|pg||
nt|vugraphzcd: director here|pg||
nt|athene: now continuing hearts will set up the @HJ in dummy for a discard|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if forrester also had @Dxx in his hand|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|yorkbeach:  Nunes double of 2@h suggests he knew it was conventional|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  with 19 Robson is too good for 1NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems that Robson/Forrester may have been playing a method that is not on their system card and the director has said that they may not do that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the bidding textbooks tell us to be very conservative with 1-4-4-4 shape because it can be so awkward in many sequences - west hand is similar to that|pg||
nt|Fluffy: 6@c is 'playable' its around 40% I think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Fluffy: going for the gamble|pg||
