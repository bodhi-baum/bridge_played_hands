mb|4C|nt|uni_dennis: transfer to @c, then show singleton @s looked simple|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|spooky: I don't know EW methods maybe he couldn't transfer to @C?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|uni_dennis: showing your singleton makes it easier for East to evaluate his hand|pg||

nt|STRIK3R: 4@d accept slam with @c, and is Cue|pg||
nt|spooky: West was just going to drive to slam|pg||
nt|geot: Lacking one keycard so they will stop in 6@C or NT|pg||
nt|bebechira: no match data ...so we do not know how many boards they scored|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: was it tactical to start with 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: playing a club slam in West with @hAQ|pg||
mb|6C|nt|spooky: East has a good hand for slam shouldnt he bid more after 3@C?|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: losing 1@c for sure, so needs to get @hs running|pg||
nt|spooky: East with his 6-6 will keep on bidding his suits|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|geot: West has very nice values for a club contract but I must admit 6@C directly was a surprising bid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: why did he sign-off before in 3NT you wonder|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if 3@c apparently showed a good hand |pg||
