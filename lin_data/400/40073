nt|drorp: double of 1@S-4@H normally means the hand is ours and i don't have a spade fit, the modern way to approach it as that the doubler should have "offensive values" so partner is ...|pg||

pc|d9|pc|h5|pc|c8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|drorp: sweden take first blood by beating 5@H with an excellent defense on board 1 (leading a trump and then not jumping with A@s so south gets and entry to play a 2nd trump)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|drorp: must play a heart now, breaking an endplay, but even with another switch declearer still has to do really well to make it|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|drorp: oh, i'm wrong, can't endplay because impossible to cash 4 clubs and 2 spades and end up in hand to exit with a diamond, so down 1 anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure @H was easy to play from N |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: true,  I was believing you :) |pg||
nt|pelu:  very good defense by the Sweden in Cr against 5@hD: @h-lead and then N ducked the @s from dummy. @sK won  and S in on @s10 next trick to lead @h again!!|pg||
nt|drorp: heart was the requesten play, south did lead his higher diamond for the 3rd trick...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|drorp: Gullberg tries this endplay sort of thing but he's a trick short, had he had 4 clubs in hand, the 4th would have squeezed south into a strip-squeeze situation|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of "up side downed" it |pg||
nt|drorp: N still thinks he needs to keep his hearts, for some reason...|pg||
nt|drorp: declearer already showed up with AK@C Q@C and J@D|pg||
nt|pelu:  N know that E only have doubleton @h|pg||
nt|drorp: having AK@H is just a little tiny bit too much for his 12-14 range or whatever he showed|pg||

pc|s9|nt|drorp: now it's already 9 tricks with 3 spade tricks coming, and a minor suit squeeze for the 10th|pg||
nt|drorp: T@S discard from hand would be the elegant way|pg||
