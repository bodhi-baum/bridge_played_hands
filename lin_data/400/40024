pc|dQ|mc|11|nt|vugraphzbc: Helgemo-Hoftaniska  - Hanlon-Carroll|pg||
nt|JRG:  As a kibitzer pointed out, E-W are the leaders, so this result could affect their score -- won't know until all pairs have finished the board.|pg||
nt|JRG:  There was a question about all boards affecting players' scores. They do, but your result on any one board obviously depends on all other pairs' results on THAT board.|pg||
nt|JRG:  And in fact, Morath=Efraimsson have slipped into 2nd place.|pg||
nt|JRG:  By 0.09%!!!|pg||
nt|JRG:  1st and 2nd (the other pair is Bessis=Volcker) is virtually a tie.|pg||
nt|JRG:  3-1/2 MP difference.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: If you look at the list it seems odd. Some pairs with more  MPs are behind others with fewer|pg||

Before that, they sometimes are out a bit because some boards are still in play. There must be more than one set of boards in play -- organizers will have duplicated them.|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|JRG:  Declarer is safe at this point.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: Hoftaniska closes the hatch and asks a question about leads, trying to sniff the queen out of Carroll|pg||
nt|JRG:  It's not possible to get all his @H away, so he's looking for a way to make an overtrick by avoiding losing 2@H and a @D|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|JRG:  He simply could not risk losing to @CQ in North in case the @H - @D position were the opposite of what it actually is|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|JRG:  So he plays it safe and will eventually lead a @H up towards the K to make an overtrick.|pg||

mc|11|nt|JRG:  Or North will do it for him :)|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|JRG:  There are only 8 tricks and no chance for a 9th if N leads a diamond. However, he may very well lead a @H and that gives 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|JRG:  It's pretty normal to lead a major when opponents have not looked for a major-suit fit.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|d2|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c8|mc|9|nt|JRG:  A lot of pairs (including my partnerships) play 2NT as a transfer and have to go through 2@C (Stayman) to invite game. That might not work well on this deal as South might venture 2@D to make sure he gets a @D lead.|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzbc: Benoit needs a notepad to explain 2@S|pg||
nt|JRG:  2@S looks like Muiderberg - 5-card spade suit and 4+ in a minor suit (here @Ds). Weak.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4S|mb|4N|nt|JRG:  I played that when I lived in Costa Rica.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||

mc|8|nt|vugraphzbc: Not the best round for the Americans|pg||
nt|JRG:  Better for E-W to defend 3@D, which they would have (most likely) beaten 1 trick -- so one of those crucial part-score decisions.|pg||
nt|JRG:  Because SOuth balanced, it's possible West thought his @DK was worth something.|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: Everyone is told to not play until all the scores are in. The players are very impatient here|pg||
