mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ennaji:  For strong hands, Gazzilli is a very powerful system. On this hand, you may also bid to four spades if West rebids 3@c and then 3@s afterwards|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ennaji:  I have some doubts about Gazzilli after 1@h-1@s when it comes to weak hands. In Tromso we have seen a couple of very bad boards in the Pairs after Gazzilli, because we were not able to play in 2@c|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|ennaji:  For example when responder had a 5-1-4-3 with a 9-count. What to do after 1@h-1@s-2@c? You have to bid 2@d and then what after 2@h? |pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ennaji:  In teams going -3 for -150 instead of -2 and -100 is not that bad, but in Pairs it definitely is|pg||
