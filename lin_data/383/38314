mb|6H|mb|p|nt|pitiful:	west needs to avoid a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|nt|pdjourdain:	A diamond lead allows the defence to play a second diamond when in with a trump and that would be awkward when the trumps were 4-1 but no problem here|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, declarer's percentage is to pick up the hearts anyway, but...|pg||
nt|dburn:  the Scottish npc asked me about this suit half an hour ago, from which one might guess that his player wasn't sure of the odds|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a big board with wales in 3NT at the other table|pg||
