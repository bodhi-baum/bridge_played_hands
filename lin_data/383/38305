nt|jmunday:  agreed, minimum hcp but with offensive potential, and does not commit to game|pg||
nt|kit: And most important, might help partner make a decision vs. some number of spades, as here.|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: The double turns out right -- but if East had club strength rather than diamond strength there might be a big double fit and the double would be wrong|pg||
