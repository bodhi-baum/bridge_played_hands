nt|vugraphzdd: last two boards|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|an|2+|mb|p|nt|gio 89: let's see if and how NS get to 6/7@C |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|gio 89: 2@C a general GF hand, probably|pg||
nt|ritong: now vanessa has a monster over 3@c|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|gio 89: yeah|pg||
nt|ritong: you wont stop her now|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|gio 89: eheh|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: asking @D cue?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ritong: establishing trump|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: ofc|pg||
nt|ritong: she does not care about controls:)|pg||
nt|ritong: except @sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|gio 89: N decided not to show her @s control from singleton|pg||
nt|gio 89: they may have an agreement regarding cuebidding in partner's suit only with A or K|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ritong: oui|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: french consensus, at least|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gio 89: bd 29 was another 13 imps swing for the Dutch|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|jeanhari: south may splinter 4@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Chick: I assume 2@C is game forcing, so there is time to cuebid after establishing clubs as trump|pg||
nt|jeanhari: is 7@C a good grand?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: not much entries in the south hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Chick: can make 7 on the diamond finesse or a ruffing finesse in spades twice, but entries might be a problem|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: will make with spades 3-3 of Kx|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: and some extra chances|pg||
nt|jeanhari: trumps 3-1 and spades 4-2 to much too handle?|pg||
nt|Chick: perhaps a @H@S squeeze?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5NT general grandslam try|pg||
nt|Chick: 5N promises all 5 keycards and the Q of trump|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no room to aks for precize things or kings|pg||
nt|Chick: but does N have enough extra to add to that?|pg||
nt|Chick: I don't think so ... @HK and @DQ are part of her opening bid, nothing more to call extra|pg||
nt|Chick: (not opening, but game force 2/1 bid)|pg||
nt|Chick: when thinking grand, if you have to debate with yourself this long, it's probably wrong :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good piont, so we expect her to bid 6?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: in 7 declarer will probably go for spades|pg||
nt|Chick: if you are from Netherlands, hope no.   if from France, hope yes :)|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Chick: diamonds are actually also part of the potential squeeze|pg||
nt|jeanhari: an make 13 tricks but very unlikely|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jeanhari: trump|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|jeanhari: uffing finesse for 12 sure tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|Chick: she can make 7 now, but my guess is that she will take a fast 12 and not worry about trying to make a 13th trick|pg||
