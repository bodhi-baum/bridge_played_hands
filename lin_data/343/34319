mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petka:  2C was 2+card game force. They play 2red as 5+card, so....|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|petka:  And possibly 2D was a waiting bid OR diamonds. This is just me guessing. The waiting hand would be NT probably|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petka:  then 2H 4SF and picture bidding|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think you are right, 2@D denies 6! or 4@H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 6S1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: damn|pg||
nt|petka:  Seems reasonable|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 6@S :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petka:  Now north has all those nice tens in support again, and needs to value her hand. She did get some club support|pg||
nt|petka:  :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 2@H looks at least semi natural|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@D sort of 4th suit|pg||
nt|petka:  perhaps 2H promised clubs, and that is reason for alert|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jeanhari: 6@C lacks a 9th trump..|pg||

mb|1D|nt|vugraphzdd: last board here, ty peter, cornelia, jean for commenting|pg||
nt|petka:  intersting to see what marion chooses after 1D-1H|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|petka:  thank you for excellent vugraph, as usual|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jeanhari: Italian ladies stayed nice low in the closed room|pg||
nt|Chick: dont' like the X, partner will never believe you have six spades |pg||
nt|jeanhari: 1@S will help south|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: thx, i am sure the kibs appreciate your expert commentary|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|petka:  I think her original plan was to double and _then_ bid spades (5+card with 17+ or so)|pg||
nt|Chick: And thanks to you, Marko, for such an excellent job as our operator :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: maybe even dbl and jump in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzdd: 2@S would be natural, yes?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: interesting now...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: or even double jump in spades :)|pg||

nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|jeanhari: tx Marko and all others|pg||
nt|petka:  W relaxed and played the DA. playing back a spade was safe. That is why I suggested spade T sneak. If W ducks she is thrown in with no exit card|pg||
nt|petka:  thx all and c u!|pg||
nt|Chick: and Marion took full advantage with a very nice endplay|pg||
