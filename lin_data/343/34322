nt|yorkbeach:  a @c lead might have been more challenging|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer does not want to lose a ruff as well as a trick in each red suit|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the high trumps would suit a crossruff but that does not look like enough tricks|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  possible slow @d loser to consider as well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  winning in dummy and taking the @d finesse will block the spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if the defenders are going to take a spade ruff then this will unblock the spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  same contract in OR but Brogeland did open 1NT so has become declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  he has taken a couple of winning finesses|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suspect Bahkshi will end up doing the same|pg||
