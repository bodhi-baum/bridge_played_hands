nt|Vugraphzfd: welcome kit|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder how Diamond handles this hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: some pairs play 3@c here as a diamond transfer, maybe we'll see that|pg||
nt|kit: Slam could be possible from his point of view|pg||
nt|kit: I think they play that, but then what?|pg||
nt|kit: It turns out that slam makes on the lie of the cards, but not one they would want to be in.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: i guess you show shortness, but very hard to find out what you need for slam|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think that 3@C "transfer" necessarily shows diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: It might be used for a variety of hands.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|an|6+!d inv+|nt|kit: Might not be so dumb to just RKC for clubs and gamble on not having 2 heart losers which opponents cash (which they might not)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|bad hand|mb|p|nt|kit: The problem with showing diamonds is that you don't really need diamond support, so why bring partner into the loop?|pg||
nt|kit: Well, he must have had a follow-through planned|pg||
nt|kit: so I'm surprised he is thinking now, if he is.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: he is; i reflexively entered martel's pass too quickly.	S and W are screenmates|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: whatever is right, bidding 3@C and then thinking isn't right.  You can't make a bid like that without having a plan.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfd: maybe he was hoping his pd would show a max and his problem would be easier / different|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe, although with that hand you know partner is going to bid 3@D.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|jkdood: Slam could be in @ds as well as @Cs, if indeed bid|pg||
nt|jkdood: East has a @H fit but will likely show values with a redouble|pg||
nt|jkdood: Various conventions abound over the double, so there are choices aplenty|pg||

nt|couchbaron:	4H is doubled in the other room|pg||
nt|jkdood: I am going to make John play 4@S in the 4-3 for penance; it could be reached by some pairs perhaps|pg||

nt|lrobb98:  Playing a short club, 2+, it is always a tough choice with 5, whether to raise...usually it seems to work out.....I think short club, where 1d=usually 5, has major advantages over older Standard American, 3+ 3+.....|pg||

nt|lrobb98:  usually 4NT= 2 or 3 suit, could be minors but if they play it has H, that complicates things......5NT was practical....|pg||
