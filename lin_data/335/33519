mb|p|mb|3C!|an|any min|mb|p|nt|kit: The Precision 2@D opening finds the club fit quickly|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C needs 2 finesses 25 percent|pg||
nt|shuster:  2@D guaranteed diamond shortness|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|pmasson:  As opposed to opening 1 Club?|pg||
nt|kit: they play strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|pmasson:  yes|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: This gives North an interesting problem|pg||
nt|shuster:  Looking at just the E/W cards, 4@S would be a fair contract.  But an awful one after the 2@D opener.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pmasson:  So, the dreaded 2@D opening survives|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: It might more than survive|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|shuster:  E/W appear to be in some real trouble here|pg||
nt|barnets: well looks like enough losers unless they evaporate|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|nt|shuster:  I don't think there is any hope of making, it is just a question of damage control|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|kit: And this may be the big decision -- to play a diamond to the 8|pg||
nt|drewsky: I doubt he will go down more than one|pg||
nt|kit: I think he should -- North can't really have a double with less than A109x, |pg||
nt|shuster:  There may be some pressure on south in the majors as well, depening on the play.|pg||
nt|shuster:  Can North just split though?|pg||
nt|barnets: north in 5@CX in closed|pg||
nt|drewsky: As long as north south keep playing clubs, it wont matter|pg||
nt|kit: He can, but can get to hand with queen of hearts for another finesse.|pg||
nt|kit: He can certainly get out for down 2 -- maybe down 1|pg||
nt|kit: He is playing veritually double-dummy from the auction|pg||
nt|kit: So we can analyze seeing all 4 hands, since declarer has the same info.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: a 3-sip problem for west (not sure the beverage)|pg||
nt|barnets: I think he will get diamonds right|pg||
nt|kit: I think best will be diamond, winning cheaply, cash one high spades, and then lead a heart to the queen.|pg||
nt|drewsky: He still hasnt pitched from the dummy KIT|pg||
nt|pmasson:  North should split, keeping control for club plays|pg||
nt|kit: he should pitch a spade I think -- that fourth heart for flexibility may come in handy.|pg||
nt|kit: So, let's say it goes spade pitch, diamond to 9 and jack, ace of spades, low heart.  Then what happens?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4-sip|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|shuster:  still in danger of -2|pg||
nt|kit: North didn't split, but I don't think that will make any real difference.|pg||
nt|kit: So ace of spade, and a heart|pg||
nt|kit: South wins and lead heart back I guess.  Win queen, and put a third heart through?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|warrens:  Maybe South wins and plays another @C|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit: all as advertised so far.|pg||
nt|warrens:  then North can pitch a @H|pg||
nt|warrens:  oops, skip that|pg||
nt|warrens:  but I think @C's annoy him the most|pg||
nt|drewsky: more clubs is best..clubs until the cows come home is best|pg||
nt|kit: Not sure -- it does let him score a small trump.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|drewsky: best is to ruff in his hand, cash queen of hearts, and play a spade|pg||
nt|kit: I think he ruffs small (pitching spade), cashes queen of hearts, and plays heart.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|cT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|kit: this might work also -- I think it comes out the same|pg||

nt|kit: very difficult for them to penalize.  Many overcalls which could go for a number in theory don't in practice|pg||
nt|shuster:  On 43, the West hand did not risk a 1@S response to 1@C and North balanced with 1NT.  NS then had an auction I don't understand to get to 4@H.|pg||

nt|kit: N-S may have to be careful to avoid slam|pg||
mb|2N!|an|gf raise|nt|shuster:	A question of whether to raise spades with a hard-to-doube but disaster prone hand like Wests|pg||
mb|3S|nt|shuster:  E/W bidding spades ought to help locate the lack of spade control|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: south can bid 5@H to ask |pg||
nt|barnets: if he deems hos hand worth it|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit: yes, but North might bid the slam with a spade contol and find they are off 2 keycards or 1 keycard and the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|kit: So, South has to decide which is the greater danger|pg||
nt|barnets: so maybe his hand is not worth it|pg||
nt|kit: This might be a penalty double -- I don't know|pg||
nt|kit: But if so, it won't collect enough|pg||
nt|shuster:  The 5-level is safe here, so if they explore, and decide to stop, they can still salvage 650|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is g/f raise x should ask for a cue|pg||
nt|kit: and what would 3NT ask for?|pg||
nt|shuster:  if 2N is GF, I wonder what pass showed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  if that denied a spade control, then South is overbidding|pg||
nt|kit: Pass likely showed no stiff spade|pg||
nt|shuster:  or making a penalty double :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|shuster:  +500 isn't a disaster, just a small loss.  But time is running short and going into the last set stuck 38 isn't a great position for Gordon.|pg||
nt|kit: So this is a likely 4 IMPs to Diamond, unless N-S have an accident at the other table.|pg||

mb|2N|an|limit+ heart raise|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|jacksond:  Still trying|pg||
nt|robinswr: over 2@s since you need a limit raise 2nt is your only choice|pg||
nt|robinswr: since 4@s would likely go for 500, its a bad bid|pg||
nt|jacksond:  Of course but he has his fans to think of and needs to declare a few more|pg||
nt|robinswr: -500 gains only 3 imps against 620|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jacksond:  Looks more like -800 to me|pg||
nt|robinswr: however -500 loses 12 imps if partner's hearts are QJ10x instead of 9865|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: thanks for watching everyone -- final match starts in about 30ish minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: see you for the conclusion |pg||
nt|robinswr: you only save at imps in slow auctions if you have a chance to make or go down only one|pg||
nt|robinswr: both vul|pg||
nt|robinswr: its different if you preempt to a save because the opponents have not described their hands|pg||
nt|robinswr: even non-vul vs vul it would be wrong|pg||
nt|robinswr: -500 is not a good save against 620 |pg||
nt|robinswr: when its right it gains only 3 imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: when its wrong it loses many more|pg||
