pc|c5|nt|paulg:  once declarer has sorted out trumps, he will have to locate the queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  some partial endplay chances to assist|pg||
nt|paulg:  actually there is no partial endplay chance, just have to find it or hope that the defence assist|pg||

mb|2D|nt|paulg:  2@c is either a very strong hand or a weak two in diamonds|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  even the ace of diamonds would be useful for North, hence key-card with a void|pg||
nt|Sheila A:  In the other room the Outreds had a confident looking sequence to 7@s, without interference|pg||
nt|paulg:  but is really looking for the @sQ|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|paulg:  6@c probably shows the @sQ and @cK|pg||

pc|h4|nt|paulg:  I'm guessing that this sequence is typical of both majors, I wonder if Liggat asked enough questions?|pg||
