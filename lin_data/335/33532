nt|Vugraphzfc: 4@D was KC I think |pg||

nt|germs345: but slam is on as declarer can hook a spade for a heart pitch|pg||

nt|germs345: Levin, however, cannot see all four hands and is trying to conjure up the best way for 11 tricks, which is clearly not obvious due to his tank|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|prospero1:  Rod suggesting a sac if Meck has real length in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|prospero1:  Here Rusinow honor leads because he bid the suit|pg||

pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|prospero1:  I haven't analyzed in detail, but I think they would be -800 in 4@cX|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: Looked to me like they were in big trouble if someone said double.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  Not uncommon to see both partners take advantage of vulnerability and end up in seven-card fits at three-level or eight-fits at four level|pg||
nt|kareno: last board will be  60 and tomorrow another sixty boards.|pg||
nt|prospero1:  My last comment referring to bridge players in general, rather than specifically to Meckwell|pg||
nt|kareno: If you think that's a lot - when I played and won the Canadian Team Trials we played 72 boards a day for six days four-handed!|pg||
nt|kareno: Kehela and Murray were part of the prize :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: but the conditions of contest probably allowed 6 on a team but you did not read :):)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lucky you, Karen :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Nope.  Only FOUR on a team.|pg||
nt|eamongall: or else Kehela and Murray were busy that weekend :) |pg||
nt|eamongall: 4 on a team ... surely Canadian health and safety would not allow that |pg||
nt|kareno: Kehela and Murray did not have to play a board - they were prequalified to the team.  Something they never did again|pg||
nt|ritong: teams of four and the winner picks a third pair is not an uncommon way to do|pg||
nt|kareno: No picking - |pg||
nt|ritong: one way or the other, that is|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|prospero1:  Rod searching in vain for something on this hand that would make a difference|pg||

nt|germs345: we have exchanged some imps|pg||
nt|olien: a swing?|pg||
nt|olien: what?|pg||
nt|germs345: 4 imps!|pg||
nt|olien: that increases the total IMPs exchanged by nearly 30%!!!|pg||
nt|germs345: there were more imps on board 2 last night than the total here|pg||
nt|germs345: 52***|pg||
nt|germs345: board 52|pg||
nt|germs345: Bramley and Stansby did well to stay out of game and earned 4 imps|pg||
nt|germs345: for those that dont know on board 52, two matches had a 20 imp swing, while the other had 17|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|meargent: will lew stand the pressure?|pg||
nt|ritong: sitting for it would be a solid gambling imho|pg||
nt|ritong: his problem is rather 4@c or 5@c i guess|pg||

nt|kareno: I feel that I would remove it as west.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Many play ReX shows doubt (a la Meck)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pef: useful to have an agreement about redouble by the 1nt opener.  in this case bramley knows that no suit is running|pg||

nt|ritong: 1)north clearly has @h AK|pg||
