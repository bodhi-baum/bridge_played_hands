mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfc: Lee stated he always takes a long time at trick 1, and to take no inference from it|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|TopWizard:  A "comic NT" by Meck|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|TopWizard:	Technically, comic NT is not allowed, so it must be done very rarely so partner doesn't ever expect it (Rodwell was warned by Lees X)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: I wonder why, at this level, they would not allow a convention that is much used in Europe (or was when I lived there)|pg||
nt|dougs:  Meckwell love to steal from the opponents|pg||
nt|kareno: n/s may have been warned off even approaching slam by this action.|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Karen, many wonder why the ACBL has restrictions; however it is welcome to the 99% who play fairly "normal" convention cards|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|kareno: Gary that is true at clubs and lower level tournaments.  But this is a Trials for a world championship.  These are not those 99 percent|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  This event is governed by the World Bridge Federation, happily, because the winning team becomes USA1 next year|pg||
mb|5D|an|0/3|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|TopWizard:  Lee is now asking for the @sQ|pg||
nt|kareno: No queen of spades, no slam|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Hamman denies it|pg||
nt|dougs:  S having 2 clubs is the killer..With 3 and a Diamond pitch, slam would be excellent|pg||
nt|kareno: Great wastage in clubs here.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|dougs:	Meck showing long clubs increases the Club duplication likelihood as well as the 4-1 spade split|pg||
nt|dougs:  Of course, if he had bid 3c, the same would be true|pg||
nt|jtmckee: and with no jack or ten   he could go down|pg||

nt|sixela: on this hand, a delayed action or 3h might have worked better, but all choices are seriously flawed|pg||
nt|medwards: Has anyone written anything definitive on defenses to trf respondes|pg||
nt|medwards: Like Bridge Winners|pg||
nt|sixela: no bjt there are a variety of ways to play against them...generally act as if the response was the natural alternative and take advantage if the extra bid you are given|pg||
