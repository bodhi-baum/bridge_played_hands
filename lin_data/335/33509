nt|athene: without that, you can set up east's diamonds for two club pitches perhaps|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|athene: EW might have specific agreements about west's bids in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|germs345: or set up the 10 of hearts for a club pitch while south ruffs in with the Ace of spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: rosenberg asks -- i couldn't interpret bertens mime re: 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: but if you are ever in this situation it's much safer to cue responder's suit rather than opener's|pg||
nt|athene: west, having passed over 1@C, can't want to bid hearts naturally now|pg||
nt|athene: so heart bids are definitely cue-bids|pg||

nt|germs345: slam is decent NS in 6@D but will fail with bad breaks|pg||
nt|athene: if diamonds come in, it's slightly better than just finding the @HQ|pg||
nt|germs345: my guess is 6d -1 after N bid 4D... south will like his hand|pg||
nt|athene: because you might be able to do something with clubs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south has a good hand here|pg||
nt|germs345: like if they are 3-3 or something|pg||

nt|germs345: yeah its not bad 3-2 trump and it becomes good|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: i believe rosenberg does promise 4@H/@S & 5+@D|pg||
nt|germs345: but i cannot imagine his not trying for slam with such prime values|pg||
nt|athene: if they do reach 6@D and west leads a heart, declarer might cash some trumps then try a low club from dummy - east had better go in with that ace!|pg||
nt|germs345: west wont lead a heart lol|pg||
nt|athene: he won't? why not?|pg||
nt|germs345: as many followers of garozzo's rule there are this one might go against it --- he knows trumps are bad hes just gonna plop down the J of @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, the @SJ is certainly a decent option, but i don't think the heart is impossible|pg||

nt|athene: if east ducks, declarer can win the king, throw the clubs on spades, and then ruff a club and squeeze east in hearts and clubs|pg||

nt|vugraphzfv: closed room still bidding  7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: open/closed room interesting historical references|pg||
nt|germs345: well maybe after 3 rounds of diamonds a club to the king and 3 rounds of spades, east must pitch a club|pg||
nt|germs345: then south ruffs a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: at this venue all tables in their own hotel room|pg||
nt|germs345: leaving east with stiff ace and then west ruffs the heart return and plays a spade, and this is where east is squeezed|pg||
nt|germs345: if he pitches a heart, south pitches the ACE of hearts from his hand|pg||
nt|germs345: and cashes the K and the now good 10 of hearts|pg||
nt|germs345: cool hand!|pg||
nt|germs345: not if west had a 3rd club ducking the club off dummy wouldnt matter as west could guard clubs|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|germs345: in 6h u could lead ur shoe and its still on a hook, while in 6d the hook maybe off and there are still chances if no club lead|pg||

mc|11|nt|germs345: bertens probably wise to check out 5h-- spades will take likely 10 tricks (maybe nine) but it gives south a forcing pass|pg||
nt|germs345: north may reevaluate his hand and bid 6h... but not likely with K108 of wasted spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: restart in 40 minutes  but other room still on  12  and other matches still in play|pg||
nt|germs345: thanks everyone|pg||

nt|germs345: so one imp to seligman after interesting view in club suit but nice recovery|pg||
nt|germs345: this board looks fun!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: thank you Jay, Doug and Zach for your comments|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|jtmckee: hsouth needed to lead trump after his heart ruff|pg||
nt|germs345: trump opening lead also would have worked well|pg||
mb|4S|nt|germs345: but im not sure double dummy ever sets 3|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|germs345: 6 hearts on a heart hook and will make- however EW have a very profitable save at any level against hearts|pg||
pc|sA|nt|germs345: alas 5h is passed out and it will either be a push or one imp to seligman depending on whether he hooks hearts|pg||
