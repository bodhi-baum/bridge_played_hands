nt|jkdood: If Gas prices would behave like openings; we'd be all set|pg||
nt|kit: And so he gets the privelege of playing in 2NT instead of 1NT for his upgrade|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|kit: He might duck this all around, hoping for a continuation.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Lower of touching honors (Rusinow) vs NT with 4 or more|pg||
