mb|p|mb|p|nt|Leo LaSota:  :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jumpshift:  this looks to be a very lucky make|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	have seen lower % games brought home before :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure they use Kokish's nt leads - K is the strong lead, unblock or count|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	jack hearts first|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	retaining lead back to hand|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|Leo LaSota:  if Rodwell ducks jack hearts, needs to switch suits|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  I dont' think he can shut out the entries to South's hand to lead up to the clubs|pg||
nt|kareno: No they can't with the diamond king doubleton|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	say it goers jack hearts ducked; if Lew does not lead middle club or diamond now, he is down|pg||
nt|chorush: double dummy he can certainly make, but will he?|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	he should and I expect that he will|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  I think declarer is going down|pg||
nt|chorush: he needs to play for the doubleton diamond K on and the doubleton club Q on|pg||
nt|kareno: Joanna, a cup of coffee bet for next time we meet?|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  he wins the spade, plays diamond to the q and a diamond,  gets back to hand with 4th diamond and lead the heart jack which holds the trick|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	Lew is a very fine declarer JoAnne :)  he will make this|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	timing on the hand screams for one rd hearts before diamond|pg||
nt|chorush: Lew is a great declarer but the heart Q is more likely doubleton than the club Q|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  okay okay,  as the kibs say "stand by by man, but I think you need to play this double dummy|pg||
pc|d4|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	this is really a rather simple hand: oplay for Kx diamonds, no ace hearts in West, but either heart or club queen and lead jack hearts right away|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	no ace in West and one queen with Kx diamonds|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|Leo LaSota:  well done so far|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  in order to give the defense any chance, Meck will need to act like a man with the heart queen and not the club queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Leo LaSota:  rid ducks, he needs to find diamond shift and he will|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	rod|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  best is to duck here|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	9 diamonds is staring him as the most beautiful card in his hand right about now|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	he loves those red 9s|pg||
nt|kareno: He can take his time - there's no knowing if he has the queen or not by a duck.  But had he quickly won the ace, then what?|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	taje your pick what rod would return in that case karen|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Rodwell thinking|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  of course, if Rod ducks this, then declarer will have to ask himself why he is being given another opportunity to repeat the finesse|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  this is all good for me - either Stansby makes the hand or Karen is buying me a beer next time we meet :)|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	Lew makes this in his sleep|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	:)|pg||
nt|chorush: Lew has rather cleverly led the 9 to disguise his holding in the suit|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  if he does make this,  I trust that no one here will report my doubt :)	|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  actually I will be the first to tell him about it|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	well JoAnne, I know that YOU would have made it :)|pg||
nt|chorush: you are welcome to report my doubt as well:)|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  why thank you Leo -  all that clairvoyant training I took, has to be helpful sometimes :)|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  the longer Rodwell takes to play the more likely he has AQ of hearts|pg||
nt|danmathies:	may need all the time avail|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	even if Meck had Qxx hearts and singleton little club|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	we would have play here; honestly this is a time that I would not have looked to disguise my hearts for the defense|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  Rod has no safe exit if he wins this trick|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  interesting choice of cards:  whether to lead J or 10 or 9 here|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	jack hearts would have come quickly; duck would come quickly from East; then low diamond quickly from South|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	if I was sitting South and East :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: players are mentioning time, 12 min left|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	this is certainly a hand where Rodwell should be thinking through every possible layout |pg||
nt|jumpshift:  Eric Rodwell is a very thoughtful player, and always with good reason|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  He won the world par contest a few years ago|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: he is thinking about the next trick, Meckstroth went to lie down (said to wake him up when R plays)|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: we are waiting for Jeff now|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	Meck has plenty of time to take naps as he is one of the quickest (and obviously sharpest) bridge minds around|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	hmm...|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	weird choice to not lead 2nd rd diamonds there|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	...|pg||
nt|jumpshift:  yeah I was expect more diamonds, but maybe he knows they are splitting from the diamond pitch at trick 2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	yeah, and maybe he is just trying to wear rodwell out so thta he has to sit out the last set :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c5|nt|jumpshift:  okay he can handle it from here, well done Lew!  and thanks for the beer|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|nt|kareno: Possibly he forgot that 2@c shows diamonds|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:	take a stab at 6H now for Lew?|pg||

mb|p|nt|jumpshift:  we saw that foul up earlier today...|pg||
