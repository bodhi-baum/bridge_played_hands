nt|kit: Of course, getting to slam after opponent opens a strong club isn't the easist thing in the world.|pg||
nt|kit: If Wooldridge makes a gambling 3NT call, he might live to regret it.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: Now it will be interesting|pg||
nt|kit: If West passes, will Bramley lead from his stronger major?|pg||
nt|shuster:  south has an interesting problem here, I guess he'll thin partner has hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Hurd is faced with a really unusual problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  I wonder if double of 3NT would call for a spade..  might be a hint for a heart when partner passes|pg||
nt|kit: and here we are|pg||
nt|shuster:  something to be said for a club lead|pg||
nt|shuster:  needs the least help from partner to generate a set|pg||
nt|kit: good point Mike|pg||
nt|kit: And that may well be his choice.|pg||
nt|kit: Particularly since if he picks a major, he will be blind guessing between the majors.|pg||
nt|shuster:  Partner is unlikely (a priori at least) to have a long solid major :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: If he leads a major it clearly should be a heart, since less danger of blockage if partner has AKQx.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: Hurd:  if that was for the minors, I'm sorry|pg||
nt|shuster:  declarer has 9 tricks without the diamonds now|pg||
nt|shuster:  but 4 overtricks at stake on a finesse that is likely to win|pg||
nt|shuster:  Kit would finesse - he values those imps!|pg||
nt|kit: by the time he gets to the diamond finesse, I think he will be pretty sure it is on.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|kit: After all, West will have to make 4 discards|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: And can't afford to discard a spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shuster:  there are only 13 HCP for West to hold if he doesn't have the @DK|pg||
nt|shuster:  well... never mind|pg||
nt|shuster:  he is playing diamonds first|pg||
nt|kit: he didn't test the clubs -- odd|pg||
nt|kit: Really odd -- since he doesn't even know how the clubs are -- West might have the queen for all he knows|pg||
pc|dA|nt|shuster:  he doesn't know clubs are coming in, either|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Well, he got the diamonds wrong -- but still has 9 tricks he will be glad to see.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Yes, but on this hand if North had the king of hearts .....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shuster:  true, but if West held a third heart, East would be the only possible right-side|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|kit: He will lead a low club to queen at trick 2 -- can get 5 club tricks even if 4-0 either way.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|shuster:  Ax is also a positional stopper - opposite JTx for example, you have two likely stoppers played from the Ax and only one from the JTx.  So both players had the hearts positionally stopped|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|shuster:  spade 7 or 8 from south would have given declarer an option to try to pin out 87 doubleton.  I doubt he would have tried it though.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|shuster:	E/W  tried three rounds of diamonds against 4@H and that didn't work out very well|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  If south had tried 3@S over 3@H, perhaps north would offer 3NT|pg||
nt|kit: So, can Stansby find the shift?|pg||
nt|shuster:  its a big shift into a strong NT|pg||
nt|kit: He will certainly lead two top diamonds, as his partner could have a singleton.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|shuster:  It could be a third consecutive push where a game swing was available|pg||
nt|kareno: So the shift is all important|pg||
nt|drewsky: Assuming a high diamond lead, east must give count, so very difficult to shift to clubs without a firm signal|pg||

nt|germs345: 3s will be very effective here|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|arjundhir: wow, well done by e/w not to get to 5m|pg||
nt|germs345: 5c can be set EW so taking there penalty here is very smart|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  on a @H lead, I see at least 5 losers, more possible if he ducks|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 53 bramley led a spade v 3N giving dec his 9th so flat|pg||
nt|germs345: lee can salvage down 2 if he flies with ace here and hooks the spade. otherwise -3 at least|pg||
nt|barnets: the only winner was a club remember|pg||
nt|warrens:  hard to get the @H's right after the X by West|pg||

mb|2C|an|6+ clubs 11-15|nt|warrens:  well, Kit, isn't Q10 doubleton by the preemptor reasonable instead of Qxx?  that, plus avoiding extra undertricks, seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kareno: Two-suited I assume|pg||
nt|germs345: no i dont think so|pg||
nt|kit: Clubs better for E-W, but hearts okay for N-S|pg||
nt|olien: I believe its a natural weak 2|pg||
nt|pmasson:  That IMP saved could be key|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting choice|pg||
nt|shuster:  Looks like N/S might take 9 tricks in hearts if they get involved|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S shows 2-suiter -- spades and spades.|pg||
nt|germs345: thats what i said|pg||
mb|2H|nt|germs345: lol kit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: :) Kit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|germs345: NS have a chance here in 3h... but not a good one|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 3@H can be beaten with diamond ruff -- may be difficult to find.|pg||
nt|shuster:  This should end the auction.  3@H can be beaten|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  also a spade ruff could work|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|kit: right -- so will take unfortunate defense to let it make.|pg||
nt|germs345: he can also facilitate a spade ruff by not continuing clubs to give east a ruff|pg||
nt|germs345: and get his spade ruff|pg||
nt|warrens:  win the J of @C's and play a @S right away?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|germs345: that works|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|germs345: or even cash the second club|pg||
nt|shuster:  6 imps riding on the defense here, either Bramly up by 7 or up by 1|pg||
nt|germs345: and then a spade and get to p in diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: But is it so clear that 3 rounds of clubs is wrong?|pg||
nt|warrens:  not sure if he'll do that or just play a @D (before or after the @C Ace)|pg||
nt|ganz:  more likely get over there with a club ruff, i think, if he adopts that plan--a little scary to play east for the diamond ace|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|d3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ganz:  or not|pg||
nt|shuster:  if you are going to shift, some players might use the order of play of your AK to say whether you are shifting to a singleton or a doubleton|pg||
nt|kit: Maybe should have shifted to spade immediately -- not sure.|pg||
nt|kareno: He could peg the club as singleton and shift to his spade for a cross ruff?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|kit: how could he be sure club is singleton|pg||
nt|germs345: going for diamond ruff|pg||
nt|germs345: bramley must duck|pg||
nt|kit: And now pressure is on Bramley to duck.|pg||
nt|kareno: 7 was the lowest and clubs weren't raised.|pg||
nt|warrens:  tough decision for Bramley|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kit: Which shouldnt be too hard -- with North marked with 3 clubs|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|germs345: no just one imp to firemand|pg||

nt|germs345: what an ending!|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|warrens:  right, one imp, wow|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||
nt|kit: Probably best was spade shift at trick 2 -- then partner can ruff ace of clubs if that is what it takes.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kareno: My thought too, Kit|pg||
nt|shuster:  500 imps over 8 sets with two boards to go.  70 imps so far in segment 8.	Very exciting set|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s8|pc|dJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|s5|nt|olien: Joel must be confused why there was no @s shift|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|olien: will he consider the drop?|pg||
nt|arjundhir: Surely bart wouldnt have bid with J10xxx?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: wool asking what opening 2@S would have been|pg||
nt|kit: It is possible|pg||
nt|warrens:  would Bramley have bid 2@S with J109xx, xx, Axxxx, J?|pg||
nt|sixela: that is doubtful|pg||
nt|kit: Boy, that would be a big play|pg||
nt|olien: or would W have passed 3@h with K Axx xx AKTxxxx|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: now asking about what 2@S in the actual auction promised|pg||
nt|germs345: and just when u think ur sure... plot twist!|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is not an easy decision, but how much harder after playing 60 boards a day?|pg||
nt|shuster:  he must be considering it, since he hasn't played yet|pg||
nt|kit: He is thinking:  Why didn't Stansby shift to a spade from his now known singleton|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|nt|germs345: he will hook|pg||
nt|sixela: because he couldnt see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|germs345: because bramley signalled diamonds-- though it was safe set|pg||
nt|shuster:  but going up with the A and catching the K... what a feeling that would be|pg||
nt|kit: But is a more logical defense than what Stansby did.|pg||
nt|kit: No -- I mean shift at trick 2|pg||
nt|sixela: the oppon often make mistakes, shockingl|pg||
nt|kit: Then partner can ruff 2nd club and get spade ruff.|pg||
nt|shuster:  I'm sure Wooldridge would rather be right at the table than right in the post mortem|pg||
nt|kit: But is this trust in opponent worth the 5 to 1 odds|pg||
nt|sixela: making a big play on the assumption that the defense played perfetly and bid oddly is not a good idea|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfu: wooldridge sitting sideways in his chair, looking away from the table, stroking his beard|pg||
nt|kareno: Why would vul opponent with singleton club introduce jack high spade suit?|pg||
nt|germs345: good point there karen|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks all :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  he has conflicting evidence.  In the case of conflicting evidence, go with the 5-1 odds.|pg||
nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
nt|kit: Not conflicting|pg||
nt|germs345: another good point!|pg||
nt|kit: Surely Bart would bid with the 5-5 shape, king of spades or not.|pg||
nt|germs345: with a 6 count red|pg||
nt|kit: It is the non-spade shift which is the only real evidence|pg||
nt|sixela: with stiff in pd's suit? why?|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, red|pg||
nt|robinswr: J10xxx/xx/Axxxx/x ?|pg||
