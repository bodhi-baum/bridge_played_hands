nt|ritong: yes, but he tries to preserver some other option i guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: preserve|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|shuster:  perhaps he'll try for an endplay|pg||
nt|shuster:  South could pitch the @SK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|shuster:  Now if south is down to @SA, @CA and @DJx, he can make by playing a spade|pg||
nt|ritong: this is more susceptible to work|pg||
nt|shuster:  so declarer has given himself a guess here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Should Lee have pitched the @sK or A?|pg||
nt|shuster:  after all this preliminary work, it would be a shame to just take a finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Perhaps?|pg||
nt|ritong: because, if south had @s AK and the guarded @d J, he would cash the top @ss before the second trump he played|pg||
nt|shuster:  hardly the way to get yourself into a bulletin|pg||
nt|ritong: the endplay is not difficult to foresee in that case|pg||
nt|ritong: so, since south has not played @s at all, presumably the @d J is onside  but all these things are double bluff positions, hence wooldridge's huddle|pg||
nt|shuster:  If North has a spade entry, then they can win and lead a diamond through to break up an endplay (in the hypothetical position)|pg||
nt|shuster:  so declarer has played to a winkle position|pg||
nt|shuster:  in the case south had KJ of spades|pg||
nt|shuster:  but that would leave north with Axxxxx of spades, and he passed over 1@H...|pg||
nt|shuster:  So North must have only 5 spades rather than 6 to an honor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Wooldridge "You guys playing standard?"|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|ritong: @s A six times plus @d K is an overcall|pg||
nt|shuster:  so he knows south has 1 diamond left|pg||
nt|shuster:  and has to guess whether he has bared the @DJ|pg||
nt|shuster:  so not out of the woods yet|pg||
nt|shuster:  playing for the drop goes down 1 less when he is wrong|pg||
