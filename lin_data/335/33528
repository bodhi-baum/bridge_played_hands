pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|kit: Obviously they wouldn't have gotten to slam if South had passed, since that would deny 11 HCP|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|kit: Many would not open the weak 2 due to the 4-card spade suit|pg||
nt|kit: But at favorable vul, there is more to gain when things go right than to lose when things go wrong|pg||
nt|kit: In fact, I would have opened 3@H, but don't tell anybody that :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: you mean it is now mandatory to open all 11 counts - |pg||
pc|s3|nt|kit: In their system, that is correct.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|passell: the 2 heart bid shut out the East west part score in clubs here|pg||
nt|kit: Resenberg thinks his partner might have underled the ace of spades, which is quite reasonable.|pg||
nt|kit: That is why he didn't insert the 10.|pg||
nt|passell: he will get a ruff and get the trick back|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but only because his Jxx of hearts happens to not be a natural trump trick|pg||

nt|kit: This probably shows this shape.|pg||
nt|warrens:  oops, too slow :(|pg||
nt|odysseus69: triple dead heat|pg||
nt|kit: Which may slow East down, since there is the club duplication.|pg||
nt|warrens:  that seems like a good agreement|pg||
nt|kit: Still, East has a very good hand|pg||
nt|kit: And if he shows any interest at all West will cooperate, assuming West has shown a 3-card diamond suit.|pg||

nt|kit: Hi might not take heart finesse, as why would North ever be leading from king on this auction?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north was on lead so he would not double 5 hearts if thats your suggestion|pg||
