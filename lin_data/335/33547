nt|BroLucius:  West's shape is not so wonderful for a take-out double, but his 14 points allow him to contest.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: 4 IMPS to Nickell (25% ajustment) for different explanations on the two sides of the screen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps not so annoying had W elected to start with three rounds of spades, though of course on this auction that is far from obvious|pg||

mc|9|nt|Vugraphzfc: west apologizes: he miscounted points|pg||

mb|2H!|an|Big|mb|p|nt|tomco1982: test|pg||
mb|2S!|an|?|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: undoubtedly S would have liked to do something in 3rd seat, especially against a forcing club pair, and double-especially at these colors. But  he has a bit too much potential ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense . For example, a light and short 1S opener could provoke a 4S save from partner over 4H, going for 500 against a nonmaking game|pg||
nt|kareno: 2@s natural or clubs - anyone know?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sorry i wrote S but i meant N|pg||

nt|meargent: 2@Hs was a pupet to 2@Ss then 3@Ds showed a big @DH 2 suiter|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kareno: Kokish-ish|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Thanks, Joey!|pg||
nt|kareno: So looks like clubs will be lost in the wash|pg||
nt|meargent: stansbys simple @H preference enabled bramley to bid out his hand|pg||
nt|meargent: west has a problem 4@Cs natural or Q bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, it is possible that 4C isnt bidding out shape but simply a cue|pg||
nt|kareno: Interesting - takes a diamond lead to beat 6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: or spade (to) ace and diamond shift (N must split heart honors|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|meargent: this sort of auction important for partnerships to sort out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent work overcoming the possible ambiguity of 4C|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, seems like 4@c was bidding out pattern and they reach the excellent club slam... bravo!!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|meargent: the key was lews simple @H preference in CR in same situation west bid 3NT NOT 3@Hs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kareno: That really made it almost impossible to find the slam.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H was a comfortable preference, as E can bid a wandering 3S if he wants to canvas W about 3N|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|meargent: think the vast majority of players would have opted for 3nt not 3@Hs|pg||

nt|medwards: Nickell|pg||
mb|3D!|an|!h+!d|mb|p|nt|Harmon: 6c great contract|pg||
nt|game over: 2@s = forced, unless you want to show a special hand, the West hand might qualify for that purpose (he has no clear route after a strong NT to show 6@c/4@s below 3NT)|pg||
nt|Harmon: very tuff to get to|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chorush: Katz would have to bid over 3NT to reach slam I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Harmon: another potential for the big clubbers at other table|pg||
nt|chorush: This is another hand that is better for a club system|pg||
nt|chorush: Not saying they will get there, but it seems impossible in standard|pg||
nt|game over: perhaps East could have found a 3@c rebid (showing hearts and clubs), but this might be my double-dummy view; perhaps he should wonder why West bid 3NT instead of 3@s (whatever ...|pg||
nt|game over: that shows in their methods)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: specifically a symmetric relay system would make quick (ok, slow and tortuous but accurate) work of this one|pg||
nt|game over: it would have been much easier if West were able to show a club suit immediately|pg||
pc|sA|nt|medwards: Diamond lead cuts off dummy but nine tricks anyway|pg||

mb|3D|nt|meargent: this hand does not play well for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: W rejects negative double due to stiff spade, 3rd seat opening, and length in overcallers' suit. The last of those features increases likelihood that partner will be acting again ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in which case  can still find the fit. |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Funny, a diamond ruff of a heart by east develops an extra trick for e/w|pg||

nt|game over: if you play standard weak twos, North has around six tricks for his opening; then South might venture an invitation, but he needs very good internal spades (like KQJTxx) and even ...|pg||
nt|game over: then he must avoid three club losers (and game is at best on a finesse, plus some small extra chances like @h Qxx dropping behind)|pg||
nt|game over: and even 3@s is not safe, as we can see here|pg||
nt|chorush: As it is, Lee must avoid the tempting line of starting diamonds or bad things are getting ready to happen|pg||
nt|game over: a heart lead is perfectly normal, but I think a diamond lead would have beaten 3@s (you get a spade ruff, three spade tricks and the @c A)|pg||
