mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chorush: however, it can be made|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Lee makes his choice after deep thought|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chorush: to make it, he will have to ruff out a diamond and then squeeze east in the ointed suts|pg||
nt|chorush: In fact, the spade lead may allow them to break the linkage for the squeeze as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: Lee "Hamman showed short @c's on the auction"; Hamman "You're right, sorry"|pg||
