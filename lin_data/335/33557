mb|r!|an|Support|nt|kit: Can Rodwell bid clubs naturally now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome Kit Woolsey, multi World and National Champion, and renowned author! :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: The natural diamond lead will wipe out one of the entries to the club suit|pg||
nt|kit: And a spade shift will wipe out the other entry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: Well, this order works also.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Let's persuade Henry Bethe as well, if he's not doing Voice, star analyst :)|pg||
nt|kit: Note that when Hamman returns a spade he must not lead top of the remaining doubleton (the 9), since that card is a trick.|pg||
nt|jtmckee: he could divine to play the 9   at tr 1|pg||
nt|kit: He could, but that would be costly on some layouts.|pg||
nt|kit: Like when his partner has AJxx.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtmckee: now he can play the 9 :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kit: Lee can work out where the 9 is, since with A98x Rodwell wouldn't have played the 10 from dummy.|pg||
nt|jtmckee: his pard knows he has 3 ergo mb some suit preference to be inferred|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meckstroth earlier "The score of the match is we're up by a Blackjack" (meaning 21) :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lee shaking his head|pg||
nt|kareno: Lee may be thinking Hamman started with K76 since normally you return the top of two remaining cards.|pg||
nt|kit: Lee knows that with K87 his partner would have returned the 8|pg||
nt|kit: And with A98x Rodwell wouldn't have ducked first trick|pg||
nt|kareno: Leaving declarer with A9 and requiring a shift.|pg||
nt|kit: So he should work it out.|pg||
nt|kit: Sorry, Rodwell wouldn't have played the 10|pg||
nt|kit: Anyway, Lee doesn't appear to have a losing option on this hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Meck: "Take your time if you have a problem" graciously|pg||
nt|kit: He can probably deduce the distirbution, since with 5 clubs Hamman would likely have bid 2@C rather than sell out to 1NT|pg||
nt|kit: And with a stiff diamond, Rodwell probably wouldn't have bid 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lee sighing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lee "Sorry, guys"|pg||
nt|kit: If Lee doesn't deduce the spade position, he will probably shift to a safe heart.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kit: True when opened 1@S, but I don't think so here.|pg||
