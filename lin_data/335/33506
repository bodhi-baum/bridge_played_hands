pc|hQ|nt|jkdood: South can get 2@C 1@S and 1@D but thats all; but East must keep North off early lead since a spade "thru" is harmful|pg||

pc|c5|nt|jkdood: a @c now and this seemingly cold contract looks down|pg||
nt|jkdood: 10 imps to Gordon if the defense prevails here|pg||
nt|jkdood: Unless the defense slips now, I dont see how this can make|pg||
nt|jkdood: Moss had a different view of the layout that exists; he can still create some issues but defense has the path avail to a set|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some very epert specs suggest variations that creat complex confusion|pg||
nt|jkdood: expert specs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jkdood: The club in North's hand can be an endplay card; if East plays @SK South must duck and North unblock the J for example|pg||

nt|shuster:  at first glance, it loooks like the @D10 coming down will provite declarer a 12 trick|pg||
nt|shuster:  but the entry situation could be tricky.  Norths club was strong, and I imagine that South has shown a positive with hearts, but it might have just been a range|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|3D|nt|jkdood: I would expect at least 6@S to be bid, and of course make|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Greco Hampson did well to bid the grand, and bring it home, in the other room|pg||

nt|jkdood: Blackwood variations are of little use when there are voids; unless a clear "exclusion" sequence is possible, which removes A of void suit from the mix. Here A@H provides a @C ...|pg||

mb|1C|nt|shuster:  this hand has action written all over it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|shuster:  East with 6/5 over the big club has surprisingly not raised the level or taken any room|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: he may not be able to show the reds|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|shuster:	Souths hand just became huge, and North has a mountain.  They could probably manage 14 tricks with careful play|pg||
nt|medwards: Might be diffulcult with two zero trump break|pg||
nt|shuster:  North would like to bid exclusion, but if he asks for keys, he'll find both and then remember that the @HA is actually a useful trick |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|shuster:  perhaps not on this diamond break|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: yeah|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  declarer can ruff one diamond low, but gets surprisingly overruffed on the second one|pg||
nt|shuster:  I bet deep finesse can take 13 tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|shuster:  a diamond lead would have helped|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|shuster:  it always amazes me how often seemingly cold grands get complicated on the actual deal|pg||
nt|shuster:  (seemingly cold looking ony at the N/S cards)|pg||
nt|medwards: Np trump lead indicates trump break|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d4|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|shuster:  Declarer might suspect an idle sixth there|pg||
nt|shuster:  East needs 13 cards...|pg||
nt|shuster:  and with only 5 diamonds, the club bid makes no sense from the other side|pg||
nt|shuster:  So declarer probably has East as 0463|pg||
nt|shuster:  so he can play @DA then noticing the 7, plat for T7 or J7 in West|pg||
nt|shuster:  and continue the @DQ to pin it out|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: only real chance seems to be kqx of hearts w seamon|pg||

pc|s4|pc|c5|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|shuster:  I suspect he is pegging hearts as 4-4, and is sad he doesn't have the entries to establish the long heart|pg||

nt|jkdood: Of course he can pitch a @C but is that surely best?|pg||
nt|jkdood: On this layout pitching a @D and guessing @c might be better?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Who said "Life is easy"? :)|pg||
nt|pmasson:  Life might be but 4@H on this deal ain't|pg||

nt|pmasson:  well judged|pg||
nt|jkdood: For any "newbies" to RKC, in MOST cases, when you show 0 or 3, or 1 or 4, if partner signs off and you have the top number, you bid on|pg||
nt|jkdood: And that seems to be part of what may have occured here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jkdood: Exceptions are if you obviously cannot have 0 or 1, for example, if you opened 2@C forcing|pg||
nt|jkdood: Making 6@D is of course easy; just lose a @C is one way, avoid any fancy stuff|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jkdood: You cannot drag trump though and give a @C; opps may cash sapdes; so some care is required|pg||
nt|pmasson:  avoiding a spade loser, of course, or a ruff, or any of that fancy stuff|pg||
nt|jkdood: True it may not be safe, or best, to give a club early; but it is easy, and should work|pg||
nt|jkdood: East would do well to duck and create a real mess; must be in tempo|pg||
nt|pmasson:  if they take it|pg||
nt|jkdood: Exactly|pg||
nt|jkdood: But then you can go back to the fancy stuff|pg||

mb|1H|nt|jkdood: USBF is the correct org; thanks specs, to thank!|pg||

mb|3H!|an|constructive "4" crd raise|nt|jkdood: There could be some 5 level action here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|meargent: and thanks to all the NS  and EW PAIRS WITHOUT WHICH ETC ETC|pg||
mb|4C|nt|meargent: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|meargent: got carried away|pg||
nt|jkdood: Hello to Joey Silver, inventor of "Nexxxxxt..."|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:	@s lead beats 4@h, but I think Sonty will bid 5@c eventually anyway|pg||
mb|5C|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Didnt expect ontag to sell...|pg||

nt|jkdood: Sontag*|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfg: sontag does the old "put down short trumps and then the last 3 cards are trumps" trick on pd|pg||

nt|jkdood: -200 as long as EW grab their @Ds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|meargent: or plus 750 if EW dont grab their @S|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|pmasson:  EW took the push to 5@H at the other table|pg||

nt|warrens:  now they have to "cash" their @s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|jkdood: ooops|pg||
nt|meargent: sorry?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: west miscounted likely because east did not have 4 hearts for the mixed raise|pg||
mc|11|nt|pmasson:  Excellent point, Dan|pg||
nt|warrens:  defense needed to get the order just right: on the @d play, they needed to play 1 round of @s and if ducked, cash the @d|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, great point|pg||
nt|jkdood: Defense needs to be careful vs 5@H in other room also|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: thanks everyone|pg||

nt|shuster:  I think it had a Queen instead of the jack though|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|shuster:  err... I'm wrong.  It was AKQJxx QJ9 xx AQ|pg||
nt|shuster:  or clubs might have been AK|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|4C|nt|shuster:  Was AQ.	Caught partner with x Txxxx AKQxx xx and they got to five hearts, which was scary, but made|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: i've historically done pretty well opening nt on hands like that but you do have the occasional totally hilarious disaster|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|shuster:	hilarious is a point of view I suppose :)  |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|shuster:	N/S are unlikely to allow E/W to play at the 4-level|pg||
nt|shuster:  West is unlikely to allow N/S to play at the 5-level|pg||
nt|shuster:  So par will not be reached :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: looks lke you can beat 4h no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: find a spade ruff in N|pg||
nt|shuster:  You can get a spade ruff if you start them roon enough|pg||
nt|shuster:  soon enough|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|shuster:  North will double|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  Club ace, south might play the king under it|pg||
nt|shuster:  then the @SJ shift, ducked... that is the most likely defense for -2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shuster:  On board 57, where Seamon bid 2NT holding KTxxx Kx Kxxxx J after LHO opened 1@S and partner overcalled 2@H, getting his side to 4@H, Bathurst raised 2@H to 3@H for a push|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shuster:  I think the decision of 2NT vs 3@H is close and interesting|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: depends a lot on how bonded partner's 2 leel overcalls are|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: south actually didn't play the ck, not that it mattered|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: i couldn't see his play|pg||
nt|shuster:  Moss bid 2@D asking over partner's 2@C opener on 58, holding the responders reverse flannery hand, getting his side to 3NT -2 for a push|pg||
nt|shuster:  thanks Craig, and everyone else, a very interesting and close match|pg||
