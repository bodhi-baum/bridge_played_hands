nt|shuster:  If  you wanted to generate action, it is not impossible to treat the South hand as 4-4 in the blacks and open 1@C.  Although that would not be recommended in a precision context.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I can't imagine why he would ever bid 2@S whatever their methods -- on xxxxx?|pg||
nt|shuster:  odd then that North didn't try 3@D to pattern out 5-5 if 2@D was bart.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|shuster:  it loses two steps, which is important if you are going to relay shape below 3NT.  Everything is a trade off.	I hold a lot more bad hands than good, it seems though.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kit: Matter of philosophy whether to bid 1@S or 2@S on the East hand.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|shuster:  At favorable, I'd expect to see the debate between 2@S and 3@S, with fringe votes for 1 and 4.|pg||
