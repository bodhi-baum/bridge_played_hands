nt|jkdood: A @D lead then a poor view in hearts could for example create some tempting losing options|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: might lead a club to the 9 on that start for sure|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|jkdood: Some of the specs "hate" leading Ax.  But its often done, and as we see by top players.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: certainly pretty appealing after south showed minors!|pg||
nt|jkdood: A great opening lead was just found by Chris W.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|shuster:  I don't think declarer can make on a heart lead either|pg||
nt|jkdood: And we see a @H lead would also do quite well|pg||
nt|jkdood: Just one trick less well perhaps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 2 losing leads...and both in the overcall suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: prob down even on c lead|pg||
nt|jkdood: NS might reaches other contracts, but the bad @d break bode poorly for all of them|pg||
nt|shuster:  A slower auction would allow west in cheaper.  Would you call 3@S over 2NT, Jay?|pg||
nt|jkdood: If I peeked at this layout, for sure, Mike :)|pg||
nt|shuster:  Perhaps I Michaels-esque 3@C |pg||
nt|jkdood: Its always awkward to be "creative" at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: 3c might be better used to show 4-6 or 4-7|pg||
nt|shuster:  I have no idea if 1@H (2@C) Pass (2NT) ; 3@C would mean this shape or if it would be fielded |pg||
nt|jkdood: Without suitable discussion, it would likely just be treated as forcing with "who knows"|pg||
nt|shuster:  Rosenberg is taking his time here.  Might he be considering that his partner has the @SAK|pg||
nt|shuster:  and that if he continues spades, he won't ever be able to establish a heart trick before the @SK is removed|pg||
nt|jkdood: Not your everyday auction for sure|pg||
nt|shuster:  before the @DK, not @SK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: maybe thinking about chris needing a H if he has kq?|pg||
nt|jkdood: The low lead ( @S5) suggests interest in suit being continued perhaps; one thing to think about|pg||
pc|d2|nt|shuster:  And it would be tempting to lead high from AKxx|pg||

mb|p|nt|germs345: North following the modern trend of opening 1NT with a stiff honor-- also due to the fact that he probably does not have a great way to show that type of hand as they play ...|pg||
nt|germs345: precision in the other room|pg||
nt|germs345: here fleisher opened an ambiguous club and got there|pg||
nt|germs345: the play however is what is interesting|pg||
pc|h2|nt|germs345: he only has 7 sure tricks to start - 4@h 1@c 2@d|pg||
nt|germs345: with J10 of clubs onside he can lead a club to his 8 for the 8th trick|pg||
nt|germs345: he will do well to find a ninth, with the A@s behind the king|pg||
nt|germs345: but a very interesting play problem here for Fleisher|pg||
nt|germs345: he has many endplay possibilities as well|pg||
nt|germs345: the most obvious to me is endplaying west at some point but he must facilitate a way to do that|pg||

nt|jkdood: So sounds like Fleisher will gain about 3 imps on Bd 34 for spades making|pg||
nt|jkdood: 9 tricks look like an uphill battle here, though N's black suit spots are yummy|pg||
nt|jkdood: Hard for declarer to see all the promise in the club suit this deal, but 2@S 4@H 2@D 1C will do it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: e-w lead rusinow from 4+, so chris will know the layout of this suit|pg||

nt|jkdood: Putting too much stock in a favorable @D position might be regretted|pg||
nt|jkdood: Craig makes an important point; it marks Rosenberg with 2 or 3 spades only|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: exactly 3.  3c was puppet.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Rusinow is lower of touching honors, when you have length (4+ usually)|pg||
