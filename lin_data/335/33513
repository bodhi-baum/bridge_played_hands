mb|p|mb|2D|an|!|mb|p|nt|jkdood: North shows about 10-15 short diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|an|!|mb|p|mb|3C|an|!|nt|jkdood: South has game interest of course and shows it|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|an|!|mb|p|mb|3S|an|!|nt|jkdood: 3N has many issues, suits break poorly and other flaws|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Nonetheless, that will be the spot to try|pg||
nt|jkdood: A @H lead should help a bit, as N's spots are good|pg||
nt|jkdood: Making 9 tricks will be quite an achievement though.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jkdood: South would guess the 9 for a huge step forward if he peeked|pg||
nt|jkdood: But wouldn't be a guess then :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: This alerts him that his best source of tricks is not behaving well; that's helpful|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jkdood: With 25 high total he expects the same contract in the other room, which is always something to consider as well|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|jkdood: Making East pitch can also give South some added opportunities in the other 3 suits|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jkdood: Ducking a spade now has much merit|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jkdood: East will be expected to have QJxx or maybe a distribution like we see, in @S... not sure a @D now was best tact|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jkdood: They had a very different auction, as N there did not trot out a 2@D convention to start|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
nt|jkdood: The low heart gave South an extra trick, things are looking up|pg||
nt|jkdood: He can see 8 for sure, more than he started with|pg||
nt|jkdood: East is under great pressure in @D and @S, a 9th trick may very well develop now|pg||
nt|jkdood: AT some point playing N's @C Q will do East in if timed well|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|c3|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jkdood: If Moss brings this in, the Gordon lead will drop to 3 imps or so|pg||
