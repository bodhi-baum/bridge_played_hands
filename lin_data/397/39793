mb|1D|nt|game over: if West ruffs, overruff draw trumps, else you can ruff the remaining hearts with @c AJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: west overruff the second spade|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|game over: then you can draw trump and ruff the last spade|pg||

nt|game over: nice play, if North discards she cannot ruff and play a heart, as you can make @s KQ separately|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: looks like my analysis was a bit off |pg||
nt|game over: if North discards on the @c Q, you can still lead a spade, If North plays the @s A and returns a heart, ruff in dummy, cross to the @d Q and draw one round of trumps, then diamonds|pg||
nt|game over: if North does not play the @s A, play on diamonds|pg||

mc|8|nt|game over: the defense missed the heart ruff here; I wonder whether East's club card could be interpreted as a suit-preference signal, but if East does not have the @s A|pg||
nt|game over: declarer might have played the @s if he had @s AK this is not clear|pg||
nt|game over: @s Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: declarer could have avoided the best defence now, by playing the @S queen at trick 1, but that looks a bit silly if it is a singleton lead|pg||
nt|game over: yes, good point; if the lead is very slow, it won't be a singleton, then this might be a good play|pg||

nt|game over: declarer has two lines of play: spade double finesse or spade/club squeeze|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|game over: the problem with the double finesse is that West might play the @s J (or perhaps Q) withouth holding the other honour|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: I think the best line of play would be to duck the lead, and then run all your hearts|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dT|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|game over: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzbc: if the defense is a bit slippery he might be able to get west endplayed now|pg||

nt|vugraphzbc: west need to discard his @D Ace at some point now, if declarer plays good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sQ|nt|game over: y, but even if declarer plays @s AK-@s ruff and WEst keeps the singleton ace, declarer won't play for it|pg||
