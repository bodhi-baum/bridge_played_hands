nt|game over: the double-dummy line I shortly mentioned earlier is still on, you can cash all red suit winners and play a club to the 10, North will get strip-squeezed, single-dummy a spade duck ...|pg||
nt|game over: does not work as North can return a club to kill the communication|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: KO Bracket uses  top 4 teams as 1-4, they pick opponents from 9-16  and [i think] 5-8 ranked according to original seed|pg||
