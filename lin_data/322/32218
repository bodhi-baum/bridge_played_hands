nt|bjacobs:  Well, I'm not sure how that helps against 6@D|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: True-- but how do they get to a diamond contract, let alone a slam|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  If you play a popular method that I like, an uncontested auction can go 2@C - 3@D|pg||
nt|frankaus: 1@C - 3@D?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  I like 1NT, whatever range they play :)  - what about you?|pg||
nt|frankaus: bird book also has a more possitive view on doubleton leads then generally thought by experts|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  yes it does ... it's a major point of the book.   On that deak, I'd go with the AK suit, but as it turns out the doubleton lead works a treat|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  deal|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Interesting rebid by Gill -- to play or invite to 3NT?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs:  I think it should be to play, but Thomson rather liked his fit.  Not a bad auction, and of course the lie of the cards is super friendly|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: This will make with the @cA onside|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The thing is ... 3@D is no better a contract than 3NT, in fact, it's a worse contract|pg||

pc|h4|nt|babs59: what about 6@D?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It's an easy game, but surely this is also a possible slam|pg||
nt|babs59: even 7@D makes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Indeed|pg||
nt|frankaus: datum for this hand "currently"  -1030 so wil cost NS |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Once again, the opening bid causes problems|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I'm struggling to think of what either North or South could have done differently|pg||
nt|babs59: even 7NT but I suspect I'd prefer 7@D :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Peakes Heart holding wrong for NT; good for slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: gag E LOL|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Anyone got any ideas what N or S could/should have done?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|bjacobs:  switched to playing 2@D as natural and weak?|pg||
nt|babs59: all I can think of is that South 'could' have looked for slam, imagining thta 5@D would be safe|pg||
nt|frankaus: at these colours many will try something|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|babs59: however, with this VP scale, it's still risky to chuck 2 IMPs - that can be quite a few VPs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs:  The trouble is, South has made a takeout double.  North could easily have just 5 diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|babs59: who recommended an 8 board scale for 10 board matches?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  On some days, North might only have 4 diamonds!|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Specs are suggesting 3@H over 3@D.  But that asks for a stopper, which North doesn't have, so really doesn't help|pg||
nt|frankaus: somedays E will have his bid :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The fact is, South has 20 HCP opposite a passed partner, and no known fit: I think his 3NT bid was eminently correct|pg||
nt|babs59: North can't have 4 diamonds - then he'd have bid 2H|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugrapha1: Dbl= probably 4-Major + 5-minor|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Oops -- not on same wavelength|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps playing a weak 2D one could bid it too|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Boards 25 and 27 show us how useful light opening bids.  (Can't resist saying it, but this is one of the cornerstones of the Fantunes philosophy)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  25 & 28, I should say|pg||
pc|c7|nt|babs59: perhaps Gill is playing X as 4M and long minor?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  This is what happens to new partnerships|pg||
nt|babs59: if that's the case, then 2@D asks for your major|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It loooks to me that Gill was doubling naturally, Thomson was responding to Woolsey|pg||
nt|babs59: and 2@C is pass/correct|pg||
