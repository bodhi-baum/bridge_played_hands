mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: each pair will be fairly happy to avoid a big loss, with the top three pairs making the 'team'|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Looks like a very sensible auction|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Typically agressive auction from Peake|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yes looks like they've done well|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: With 2 hons in partner's suit is is usually a good idea to raise|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugrapha1: Note 3NT has no play on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yes, its often a bad sign for NTs when an opponent shows a long suit and a good hand|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: as they'll quickly set up the suit, AND have entries to cash it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Perhaps not true as S might effect an endply on west|pg||

pc|h9|pc|d9|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Yes to make 3NT S will have to guess the right distribution|pg||
nt|babs59: I think the shape becomes a bit obvious, esp with the rebid by West|pg||

nt|babs59: I think I'd bid 4@S in Klinger's seat anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|babs59: sorry, my internet seems to be very slow responding right now|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2NT 22-23 bal|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: 3@d = 1 o2 4- Major; 4@d = pick a Major|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: NS off to a good start this match after the first 2 boards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|babs59: looks like they play Puppet Stayman - the West hand is much easier to bid playing Smolen (when a 3H rebid shows 4 hearts and 5 spades)|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: this would you hope would be a flat board across the firled|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: true|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Smolen not popular in Oz;  probably because of the name|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
mc|10|nt|babs59: I assumed its lack of popularity was due to lack of awareness about systems and bidding|pg||

nt|babs59: so anyway, on board 12 EW had a very good save in 5@H too|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: its a trade off, you can find the 5-3 fits with 5-4 but you can't find the 5-3 fits when opener has a 5 card major|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: yeah I think there are better forms, like the muppet you mentioned|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Unlucky lead|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: if Peake was going to lead that suit, he really should have tried the king, don't you think|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: The ruefukl rabbit would have dropped the @hK on the table|pg||
nt|babs59: only when dummy has stiff Q|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|babs59: if partner held the A and declarer the Q then he shouldn't|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|Fugitiv: yes put that one down as a mistake for Peake :p|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|babs59: not that he has any entry!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: yes Peake definitely needs to learn how to lead after that last debacle|pg||
mb|1C|nt|babs59: Klinger and Peake lead on 117.08|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: That might stop Klinger in his tracks|pg||
nt|babs59: Wilkinson and Ware on 109.74  so this match is very important|pg||
nt|babs59: Thomson and Gill on 108.54|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Peake has also had some very "bad" leads whenever he was on BBO|pg||
nt|babs59: (apologies if I have a decimal point wrong)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Fugitiv: interesting choice of call from Klinger there|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: do 7321 shapes count as balanced now|pg||
nt|babs59: practical?|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: is that advocated in one of his books?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|babs59: I know I've done it with AQ109xx after 1C|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yeah 6 I could stomach|pg||
nt|babs59: guess they must play 2C as artificial?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Peake might end up playing this deal in Clubs!|pg||
nt|babs59: but the opps never lead the suit :(|pg||
nt|babs59: (mostly void :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: hehe|pg||

pc|sA|nt|Fugitiv: showing the 7 card suit?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes :)|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: or 8?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: written bidding again has got me Peake bid 3NT down 2|pg||

nt|babs59: you do like to booby trap us commentators Peter|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|Fugitiv: Peake's quite lucky 5c went off on the bad break, I think he should have found that contract on the auction|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Crikeys! Why would you not bid 3@d on North hand?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: I guess Klinger didn't mind hearts as trumps|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|Fugitiv: and didn't want to be dummy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Now Wilkinson might ask himself why klinger did not raise with KQx@d|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Perhaps Klinger was worried they might pust to 4@h if he raised diamonds|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Maybe he's seen too many of Peake's overcalls|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Ahh --- now we are getting closer to the truth|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|babs59: depends how often he's played with him :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|s7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|babs59: I suspect at the 2-level they are a lot sounder than his random 1-level overcalls though|pg||

nt|Fugitiv: yes 8+ points at the 2 level|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: he was at favourable then though|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: We've all played against him often enough|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|babs59: I can't remember the reason he gave for bidding - perhaps it was because he held 13 cards?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 1@h = spades|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Dble = support double (3-Spades)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: can ware find the pass|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: probably not|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: has he seen enough of Peake's bidding yet :p|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: hard to imagine he could pass at imps, but what would you bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: gutsy|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|Fugitiv: EW have been defending well from what I've seen|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: a low heart next will put them in a great position|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Michael had better not lead a @d now|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Michael could easily visualize partner with a singleton diamond I think, for the pass of the double|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: A high club for herats, would be better from Ware|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: West will know declarer has 4 spades, therefore 3 hearts at the most|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  he might simply be encouraging a club continuation|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yeah I expect so|pg||
nt|babs59: Im pretty sure that even @DJ is ok|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Klinger opened 1@c so @cA looks more like a singleton|pg||
nt|babs59: because next time the @DK means the @DA gets ruffed out|pg||
nt|babs59: but a @H lead looks nicer to us, double dummy|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Wilkinson going thru the wringer now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|babs59: can't say I would have predicted a trump there|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: well partner should have strong trumps for the pass of the double|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  he was being hippocratic: first do no harm|pg||
nt|babs59: agree|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: he may have beenthinking|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|Fugitiv: a low heart was quite risky too if the jack and queen were swapped|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  right ... leading from a nothing suit couldn't blow anything|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|babs59: I liked West's extra heart|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps Wilkinson is hoping partner holds the @D5?|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Peake will be worried about letting East in|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yeah, both South and West want to know if East has a 2nd diamond|pg||
nt|babs59: assuming the @CA lead was a singleton, South should have the answer|pg||
