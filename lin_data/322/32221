nt|vugrapha1: Yes this system goes back a long way|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|frankaus: they played 20+ years ago as a regular pair|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N always (11)12-14|pg||

mb|r|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|vugrapha1: 2@c was forced by the XX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL  forces 2@C	to play some 1-suiter|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  OK, now not so weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: ahhhhh   apologies Mr Bilski|pg||

nt|ahollan1: unless using original windows bbo -- click on player name to see picture, access CC and other stuff  [thanks Traian]|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Experts dont like to splinter a singleton Ace|pg||
nt|frankaus: I am off soon to bubbly and canapes on Sydney Harbour cruise - tough i know but someone has to do it :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Enjoy Frank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: M*A*S*H:	it's a kush job, but somebody has to do it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:	Yes, splintering on stiff ace is unpleasant, but someone has to do it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: It would work very well on this deal|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:	in theory yes, but it seems they'll reach slam anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Just with less confidence|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Inspired move by Wilkinson|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember	1@D opening did promise unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well, presumably 4@H showed a mighty fine hand anyway.  But if were really inspired, he would pass, as this slam looks doomed to me|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: that probably rules out 2452|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: RDBL confirms 1st round control of @C|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I'm told 4NT was a spade cue, as they play kickback blackwood (4@S wouldhave been Blackwood)|pg||
nt|frankaus: GIB -1|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good spy there Bill   showing @S control makes much more sense than taking control via keycard ask|pg||
nt|frankaus: failing slam are really costly at any form of scoring - including this 1|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  This is why I hate this form of scoring ... wouldn't be seen within 1000 miles of this event|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Bid excellent slam, go down, lose whatever, can't stand it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Not least that the new WBF scales were not designed for Butler pairs|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with computer scoring -- why oh why do they use this method rather than imp against all other tables?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Hang on a sec - you're the author of the new WBF scales: what gives?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Cross Imps also has problems for small fields such as this|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yeah, cross imps doesn't help.  Nothing does.  Ifb the ABF were ahead of its time, they'd use matchpoint scoring for this pairs playoff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelepele: just appoint a selection committee makes it even easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: true    Imp Pairs just has basic flaw|pg||
nt|babs59: then again, we could get rid of Pairs Playoffs too?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs:  even better.  waste of time|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  and the authorities don't even have to be "ahead of its time" to do so|pg||
nt|babs59: just 'sensible', yes?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h9|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  yep|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: what do top 3 pairs earn in this Off Year  [neither APBF nor World Championships are country-specific in 2014]|pg||
nt|pelepele: but no one from ABF MC will be watching the vugraph deabte !|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps you could send the ABF this chat log then?|pg||
mc|10|nt|babs59: they earn prize money|pg||
nt|babs59: for the first time ever|pg||
nt|frankaus: just ask Tim (Seres) and Dick (Cummings) to pick their teammates - like the old days :)|pg||
pg||

nt|babs59: and also the right to play for Australia in the 2nd Asia Cup|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: The target event for this team will be the Asia Cup in China|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  as a paying member of the ABF I am not a little confused about my fees going to prize money for this event|pg||
mb|2D|nt|pelepele: but ABF will not send a team to the world championship this year|pg||
nt|babs59: the Asia Cup is every 4 years - and combines Zones 4  6  and 7|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: weak-weak 2-Major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D always weak 2|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|bjacobs:	After all, Griff Ware might win some prize money, and with a 2@D bid like that, he doesn't deserve to!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL = pass/correct|pg||
nt|babs59: the 1st such event was held in Ningbo in China|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: the 2nd will also be in China|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Dbl = P/C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: prize money will be barely cover costs of representing - its not like its $1.0 million|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bjacobs:  Well, I never thought I'd live to see it: a multi paying off when the opps play in my suit|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: very unlucky draw in dummy|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|babs59: if the placegetters choose to go to the 2nd Asia Cup each player gets an additional $1,000 to cover costs|pg||
nt|babs59: if the placegetters choose not to go, then down to 6 gets offers, and gets $1,000 (I think)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs:  it's not how much money, it's the principle.  I am all for subsidising Australian representation, but not simply handing prize money away|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|babs59: at the time they decided to have Playoffs, they argued they had not been invited to a target event|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|nt|babs59: the idea of the prize money was to use it to play some international event|pg||
nt|babs59: actually use it to improve our games|pg||
nt|frankaus: i think ist poor that reps end up out of pocket|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  There is no target event once every 4 years.  This event is a waste of time.  Not sure why I'm watching :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelepele: if you cancel trials, save $25k or so and select the teams  the saving can go to the selected players|pg||
nt|babs59: I agree, but for the past few years subsidies have been way better than they were 30 years ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should Wilkinson have led @D instead of @C   in case Ware's @S spots not as hefty|pg||
nt|babs59: selecting players is not fair if it's not been part of the methods and not pre-advertised |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pelepele: Am i missing something.....there is no Bridge world championship this year ?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Agree 100%.  We should never go anywhere near the ridiculous approach of selecting teams|pg||
nt|babs59: selecting players if fine if it's obvious who are the best pairs|pg||
nt|babs59: one of our problems is that many of our top players aren't in regular partnerships|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It's an open event Charles.  Not a country thing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there is  2014 world championship - but not country specific   Open=Rosenblum Cup|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i don't remember name of the Women's Event :(  |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|babs59: correct - hence the ABF does not send 'Australian' teams to a non-country specific event|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|ahollan1: transfer responses|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: opening 2N would be 22-23  so this sequence   20-21|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  does this system have a name?|pg||
nt|babs59: this is the Ware-Wilkinson method with 1C and transfers|pg||
nt|babs59: I rather like it, I must say|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Their system is called " modified 2/1"|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: working 4 them :)|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|babs59: not only that, this is a regular partnership and they know their system very well|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|babs59: they've been getting some good results recently - won the Spring Nationals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of that 2@C opener -- i prefer the treatment where  1@C-1R-1N = just above strength of 1N opener|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Wilkinson might now get the spades right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It might be a restricted choice situation in spades?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Brown hesitated a long time -- so he knows where the Ace is|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  He'll certainly know where the ace is, when it later captures the queen|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Interesting|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s8|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs:  Perhaps he was hoping that the @SQ would be a later entry ... the deal being more than just about the spade suit|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Would Brown duck with only 2 or even three spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I guess: suppose West started with @S109x, then East might go up with the ace, and there's your entry|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|bjacobs:	But on the whole, it was probably a mistake, if a subtle one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cute  west played for declarer error   declarer played for east error|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|bjacobs:  East is disappointed:  partner's high cards are just not in the right place|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  I disagree ... I think 3NT was fine|pg||
pc|s9|nt|babs59: I think that's very harsh Peter, I think Terry Brown's 2NT bid was ultra aggressive|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|babs59: he could pass the 2@CX as a forward-going move if he wanted|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs:  Yes, if there was any blame here (and I don't think there's that much) it has to go to East|pg||

pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|hJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|babs59: I can see East has lovely long diamonds - so maybe passing 2@CX is justified, but 2NT is crazy|pg||

nt|babs59: but it can make life harder for partner to judge|pg||
nt|babs59: that's fair too|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Well, both players were aggressive here. West certainly had no extras for his cue raise|pg||
nt|babs59: he didn't have extras, but the 2NT did encourage him unnecessarily|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  People like to bid vul 3NT contracts.  Going 2 down in them sometimes is part of the equation|pg||
nt|babs59: as long as you don't get doubled :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = a) 10-20 HCP, any 5440  b) 12-21 HCP, any 4441  c) BAL, 21-22 or 25-26|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|d8|nt|babs59: I use transfers over multi 2@D and the mini multi too|pg||
mc|10|nt|babs59: which is very different from the 'regular' defence used here|pg||

nt|babs59: the main benefit of my structure is that we can show our 2-suited hands a lot more easily|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Last brd before the lunch break. Reconvene at 1:50pm (1 hour from now)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to be honest  i wasn't going to be surprised if either/both of you said  start with  2@D-PASS|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So double = hearts Barbara?|pg||
nt|babs59: I was about to say that I'm not sure I'd opt in with that spade suit :)|pg||
nt|babs59: yes Bill - either hearts or a really big hand (18+)|pg||
nt|babs59: are you trying to extract my secrets from me Bill?|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  That's the question isn't it?  Playing stndardish methods, you can either double to show a decent hand, or bid 2@S with that moth-eaten spade suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|babs59: I might have been defending 2SX as East...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C multi-purpose, forcing|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Wilkinson/Ware up 12.4 to 7.6 Vps |pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: Peake Klinger on 101.32|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  And the status of 3@H in response to 2@S ... that's another really difficult question.  I think on the whole, it is best played as a cue bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: Wilkinson Ware on 100.49|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Very conservative by EW here|pg||
nt|babs59: Kanetkar Nunn on 98.10|pg||
nt|warrens:  went pretty low here.  I'd like to be in 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very diplomatic by operator|pg||
nt|babs59: Thomson Gill on 93.|pg||
nt|babs59: Brown Bilski now 91.|pg||
nt|babs59: (I can't remember decimal points)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  What happened to the heart suit here?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I'm playing a bit with Terry Brown so I have to be!|pg||
nt|babs59: the rest basically out of contention|pg||
pc|dT|nt|warrens:  hearts got lost as did the vul game in either suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Would yiu bid 3@s on south hand?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|babs59: yes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well I would, but as it turns out, South did extremely well not to goad E/W|pg||
nt|warrens:  me too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: immediate 3@S rather than 2@S -- indeed|pg||
nt|babs59: but I'd have bid it over 2@C|pg||
nt|babs59: snap|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: That's what I meant. Over 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: going low gave EW room to underbid too|pg||
nt|warrens:  how many clubs was promised by 1@c?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ZERO|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I still can't work out why hearts were never mentioned.  Doesn't an 8-card heart fit open the pearly gates?|pg||
nt|babs59: Polish 1@C bid|pg||
nt|babs59: I would have thought Bilski should bid 3@H since he had the space to do so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well  Polish only in sense of  multi-purpose   but the options very different than Polish Club variations|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: George seems to have double-crossed himself by bidding only 3@c|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: maybe he missed Ware's 1@S bid|pg||
nt|warrens:  what was the range for 2@c?  must be pretty low|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Treating @cJ as suit pref?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then  Brown's 2@C = 5/6@C, 0-5 hcp|pg||
nt|babs59: perhaps he thought 3@C was forcing?|pg||
nt|babs59: so Terry downgraded??|pg||
nt|babs59: a rare moment|pg||
nt|warrens:  tricky.  East had a perfect 6-count for West|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Perhaps he's thinking to leave @sQ as an exit card for an endplay|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  yes, perhaps this pair of hands just hit a seam in the E/W methods.  West is no doubt regretting not opening 1@H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: way too strong for 1@H opening|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs:  oh ok|pg||
nt|babs59: results to date on this board - 6@C making  and 4@SX NS down 500|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: 1@D/@H/@S openings limited to 16|pg||
