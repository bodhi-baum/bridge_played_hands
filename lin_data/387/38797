nt|game over: I like South's ead, as you probably cannot force declarer (with spades 3/3) and you don't need to lead aggressively here|pg||
nt|game over: *lead|pg||

mc|8|nt|robinswr: one of the advantages of Multi is that the strong hand plays it|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|game over: you don't need much for a slam, for example xx xxxx QTxx Axx leads to an ok slam|pg||

nt|game over: but on the other hand you get doubled (sometimes) and the opponents are forced to guess|pg||
nt|game over: hi Bob|pg||
nt|robinswr: over a 3-rd seat opener, it makes more sense to go slower|pg||
