mb|p|nt|ahollan1: yet another strong 1@C|pg||
mb|1C|an|strong|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: EW  2N opener is minors, so 1@C really covers ALL 16+ hands|pg||
mb|1S|an|!|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S = BAL, 9-14, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N is natural, but acts like stayman|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 12-14 hcp, not 4333|pg||
mb|2D|an|!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D = RELAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H = 4@S, not 4@H|pg||
mb|2H|an|!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Luz doesn't believe my alerts  until players confirm|pg||
mb|2S|an|!|nt|ahollan1: 2@S asks AK points|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think step 1 = 0-2, but not positive|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I believe you Al :)|pg||
mb|3D|an|!|nt|3for3:  al tends to know these systems better than the players themselves|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D = 4 controls	A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was REALLY true with Walter Johnson [bigtrain] and meckwell |pg||
nt|3for3:  Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|an|!|mb|p|nt|3for3:	So EW have 11 tricks plus whatever ruffs they can score...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drat - i'm unsure about 3@H   - guessing it asks specifically about @H holding|pg||
nt|3for3:  q@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if right, step 3 would be 2nd round control but not 2nd & 3rd|pg||
nt|3for3:  I'd have to guess he would need to know more about spades first...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd & 3rd means either  K-doubleton or KQ(x)  [remember Stewart denied 4@H]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still time to find out about @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Woolsey also had option to discover Stewart's full distribution before asking for controls|pg||
nt|3for3:  So, we can see EW can make 13 tricks in spades.  Will they find it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so there is a lot of ART to application of this science|pg||
nt|ahollan1: holler if you want spoiler alert  [in other window i see Open Room auction]|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C fits my guess   so @HKxx  [can't rule out KJx]|pg||
nt|3for3:  7@S requires the jack of spades to behave, and both ruff to live...or a squeeze...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Stewart must be 43(42)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|3for3:  Rigal Aker +2210, so 13 imps at stake here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 6N VERY preemptive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Woolsey knew about AKK   but stewart promised another 2-4 hcp|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Woolsey: "I know he made a mistake in the bidding but dont know which one"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmmm   i thought stewart was spot on|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the statement sure explains the jump to 6N|pg||
nt|3for3:  That explains the 6NT leap, wanted to forestall future errors|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: or what Danny said	  i would never use the word forestall :) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: which squeeze do you try to set up?|pg||
