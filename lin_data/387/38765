nt|TopWizard:  Bramley may bid 6@d here|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Stansby couldn't raise @h's|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  BINGO|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  Huge pickup with this fine auction, and the disaster at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't quote me, but i believe  that 1@C-(3@S)-PASS would be forcing  so there IS expectation that Stansby has at least @Hxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: world class|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: after they finish play -- can we rebid the hand with Rigal jumping directly to 4@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 18 imps?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: recount 17|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Al, grab another coffee :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  Even if he were to somehow go down, he'd still WIN 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't even stand the smell of that swill|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: immediate 5@H weaker than actual sequence just confirmed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: overtake hoping to give @C ruff?|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  This is called "results not meshing" because both of your pairs have near top results, compressing the IMPS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: aka   overkill|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 3 minutes on clock, directors have been liberal with time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. bidding slam only gained 3 imps    [sorry if Gary already said that]|pg||
