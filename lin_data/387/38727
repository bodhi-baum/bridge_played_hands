mb|2D|an|"I think natural" Greco|nt|game over: I guess East could not pass X in order to play in 1NT XX; my guess is that 2@c shows @c+@h, but it can also be a general run-out without a long suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|batman98: I believe the  USA1 that qualified for the Bermuda Bowl was the Nickell Team|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|game over: this hand is/was quite complicated, it looks like North might have figured out that he needs three spade tricks (along his two heart tricks and one club trick to beat the contract)|pg||
