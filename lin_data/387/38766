mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|meargent: hamman does not like missing games|pg||
pc|d5|nt|game over: 3@h = courtesy raise, as we can see here good judgement as 4@h is a very good contract|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H could have ended things but Hamman finds another call on his 3-count|pg||
nt|athene: it is a pretty respectable 3-count, to be fair :)|pg||
nt|meargent: suprise watson did not bid 3@Cs he is young enough|pg||
nt|meargent: lee floped pretty good|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see there is no problem coming to 11 tricks but declarer is thinking about a less favourable lie in the majors|pg||
nt|athene: for example if you bash out @HAK and then lose the lead and a defender cashes the last trump, you might run short of tricks sometimes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: thinking|pg||
nt|athene: it feels natural to try to establish spades rather than diamonds, because north is stronger and hence has more entries|pg||
nt|meargent: in CR south passed the 1@S openng and EW made there way to 3NT |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: now perhaps concede a club?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: intending to ruff a club and lead another spade up|pg||
nt|meargent: looks like this line will net 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|athene: when the @SK holds it is fairly likely (though not certain, at top level) the @SA is right|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: so declarer really wants to lead spades from dummy again|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: it would be hard for east to duck the @SK because he doesn't know declarer has @SKQ|pg||
nt|meargent: the 22@H split relieves all of declarers worries|pg||
nt|athene: it's quite nice for declarer that his @DA is preserved as another entry to hand|pg||
nt|athene: he is now wondering whether to cash the @HK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|h4|nt|game over: now it is fairly safe to ruff a club and play a spade as E/W lead 3/5|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: of course this allows west to play another spade and promote the @HJ|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer is not worried about a trump promotion with trumps 2-2|pg||
nt|athene: he was just worried about trumps 3-1|pg||
nt|athene: he only needs ten tricks, not eleven :)|pg||
nt|game over: yes, and he knows that East does not have five diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes, risk of a diamond ruff is very low, the way things have gone|pg||
nt|meargent: declarer aint worried about any overtricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2H|mb|2N|nt|athene: 2@H showing a good spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT lebensohl, i guess|pg||
nt|athene: asking for 3@C from east, and intending to bid 3@D then showing a weakish 3@D competing hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|meargent: or pick a minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whereas 3@D direct over 2@H would be a better hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|athene: north had more encouraging noises available than 3@S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|game over: yes, but almost no South hand possible which offers a good game|pg||
nt|athene: he had the whole 3-level available (not to mention double) if he wanted to really invite game or something|pg||
pc|h5|nt|meargent: lee looks likely to scramble 9 tricks but to be sure stay tuned|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|athene: the defence can play hearts through but declarer's trumps are good enough to stand it|pg||
nt|meargent: liu wasnt selling at 2 level was against the LAW|pg||
nt|athene: he has no useful minor-suit loser he can throw, but he can afford to ruff high|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: wow, that is surprising|pg||
nt|athene: why does west leave his partner on lead?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|meargent: CR playing 3@Ds|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought you overtake and play a little heart back|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|game over: lookd obvious, and could have beaten the contract if East had @s Jxx|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: west can see from the clubs that playing trumps is not going to beat this contract|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|meargent: west really has limited choices and trump looks best|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer led the little club (rather than the @CJ) so that east did not know he had a possible guess|pg||
nt|meargent: liu should quack the @D|pg||
nt|athene: if east just had the ace, he is more likely to go up with it|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is now the suit is blocked if you end up wanting to finesse for two club tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|cT|mc|9|nt|athene: but usually when a strong defender does go up with the ace in these situations it is because he has ace AND queen|pg||
nt|game over: what if declarer had @d KJxx is then leading a trump better than continuing hearts? I don√Ñt think so because declarer probably must establish the clubs in that case|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: he actually led @cj on first play of @c|pg||
nt|meargent: ahh|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|athene: ah, ok :) he didn't bother trying any psychology in clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: probably had decided to play for @CQ onside from the start|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|meargent: watson felt he had enough HCP to pass 1NT and not risk the 2 level in @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: the defence should come to three clubs, @SA, @HAK, and @DQ now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|meargent: lee has a very unatractive hand to lead from aganst 1NT but he ended up choosing best lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: declarer can see that if he plays on diamonds and loses a trick there the defence surely have seven, but anything else is probably worse|pg||
nt|athene: and this does put a bit of pressure on north|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: on the other hand, if declarer had something like @DA109xx or @DK109xx, would he really tackle the suit this way?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|game over: North might duck at Trick 2, he needs one useful card from South and it is more likely that South has the @h K than the @d K|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|game over: so I think his play was a good play|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s2|nt|meargent: beting that when liu next gains the lead he will be 1 down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: if declarer had weaker diamonds (and hence the @HK to make up his points) he would surely noodle around a bit more (play on spades, for example)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: because he would really want to lead diamonds from dummy|pg||
nt|game over: yes, or on hearts if he happens to have four hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: a BIG part of defence consists of thinking "if declarer had X, would he be doing this? - no, so he hasn't got X"|pg||
nt|athene: this resolves quite a lot of guesses|pg||
nt|athene: and at his level at least you can assume declarer is sane :)|pg||
nt|meargent: au contraire|pg||
nt|meargent: how many sane people dedicate thir lives to reach this level|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: long thinking|pg||
nt|athene: the play began similarly in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: but then declarer had to cash his diamonds before he really wanted to |pg||
nt|athene: and dummy got squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|meargent: declarer might have avoided that by playing a @S before @Ds|pg||
nt|meargent: at trick 2|pg||
nt|meargent: but the @D return in CR was excellent|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|game over: so the same (suicide squeeze on East) could have happened here if North had returned a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer wondering whether to finesse the @D9 |pg||
nt|athene: he is thinking how long it took north to go up with the @DQ|pg||
nt|athene: with @DQx surely he would have done it faster|pg||
nt|athene: so no need to finesse|pg||
nt|athene: south can't have @D10xxx|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: north's job here is not to throw his @SA away|pg||
nt|athene: i think he'll manage it|pg||
nt|game over: blanking the @s Q is a good play as this gives North one more thing to think about ;) :) (he knows that South has the @h K)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: sorry having trouble typing it in!|pg||

pc|h7|nt|game over: tough decision, but opposite most maximum North hands game is at best on a finesse (unless North has five small hearts or 9xxx in hearts)|pg||
