nt|3for3:  3NT presumably 'non serious'|pg||
nt|3for3:  IE a hand that can cooperate in slam investigation, 'not the worst'|pg||
nt|3for3:  A driect 4 level cue would then show extras|pg||
nt|3for3:  When hearts a trump I prefer to show the spade control below 3N|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|3for3:  4@S might be Kickback...|pg||

nt|jkdood: The play will go much faster than the bidding.|pg||

nt|jkdood: HI Danny, all.|pg||

nt|3for3:  But can he have a gran opposite 3NT non serious?|pg||

mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ritong: 5NT mandatory|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Usually playing room is distant from Hotel Internet source|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  N denied any King|pg||
nt|ritong: and south must accept that  perhaps considering NTs |pg||
nt|ritong: not sure why he would play in NTs, but..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|TopWizard:  S wondered if @d's were running for 5 tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: perhaps north has a diamond suit to provide the extra tricks - north would have bid 4NT with AQJxx diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: the question of the trump queen did not seem to bother south|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  N could have @d Queen and no @c Jack|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: :)|pg||
nt|3for3:  just ONE of the reasons :)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jkdood: LOL.   and some specs "suggest" 3@D.... |pg||
mb|3N|nt|3for3:  OK, EW will settle in to 4@S here|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:	Should Brady pull to 4@H?|pg||
nt|jkdood: 4@H will survive as well it seems|pg||
nt|3for3:  With Jx @D might sit it out|pg||
nt|jkdood: 3!N is a GREAT matchpoint spot....|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|jkdood: With a low @D lead, at imps, declarer may eschew spade finesse tho IF in 3n|pg||
nt|3for3:  Brady thinks Ganzer was too strong to double..|pg||
nt|jkdood: Specs point out 12 tricks available if no @D lead.... unless its a low one, then 13:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: i dont understand (mb i am too beginner) why he didnt just bid 2N (instead of x)|pg||
mb|6N|nt|3for3:  even on  a low @D, Grabel can cash AK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  Grabel should NOT double here..|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  But...then |pg||
nt|jkdood: So the many specs who like 2N for West to start are thinking the double caused all this problem we now see|pg||
nt|3for3:  might this double talk weinstein into a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|jkdood: 2N would be my choice also... Danny, chime in please.|pg||
