mb|d|nt|tejjyid: @S and other, I think|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2@d = S + other; if hearts then longer Hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure what west does now |pg||
nt|sybarra: pass? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: Kind of curious - X is not usually played as pure penalty these days|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: West is not sure either|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might be some sort of take out? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: Looks like penalty of @S, but may just be cards|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: It's not impossible to make 10 tricks in @@S - for EW|pg||
nt|tejjyid: OK, you probably get tapped out on @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: suggested by a spec,  the meant I can double one major |pg||
nt|sybarra: the X meant ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: X explained as "values"|pg||
nt|sybarra: a 6 count=values  |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: West can bid 2@S - make East suffer in turn. Arguably it would show a @S stopper and ask for help in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: you slam the card in the tray when	9 or 10 pts? |pg||
nt|sybarra: just kidding |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|sybarra: now surprised S passed, but maybe pard has been seen in action before |pg||

mc|6|nt|vugrapha1: EW discussing what "values" means !!|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Probably the 1st time either of them has engaged in a philosophical discussion :)|pg||

mb|1N|nt|sybarra: here we go again |pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugrapha1: yes: two in a row|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Well, they hav't bid his suit yet|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: go to http://www.abfevents.com.au/events/playoffs/2014/ow/results.asp for borad results|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so 3@C in one form or another is probably do-able|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tejjyid: NIce to play 2NT for minors here (as I once did, in fact)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It was a gadget I took from Sebesfi|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 5@c is a make for EW if NS donr find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|tejjyid: who had a lot of ideas about competitive auctions after 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: Axx and Qxx - never such good stoppers as you think|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|tejjyid: West says, thanks...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Norths actions certainly backfired|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|tejjyid: haard for North to viusalise the singleton @D|pg||
