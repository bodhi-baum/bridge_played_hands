I believe that 25 turned up which has complicated the scoring somewhat. |pg||
mb|p|nt|davisbiz:  Goulashes typically produce freakish hands with strange distributions - West's hand being a typical example. |pg||

pc|c8|nt|davisbiz:  Part of the secret of playing this form of the game is that you put pressure on the opponents at a high level - North's Six Spades here a good example. |pg||

mc|6|nt|davisbiz:  A good working rule is that your first priority is to get a plus score - which often m eans not bidding as high as you would normally do, given the likelihood of sutis breaking badly. Here South cannot even make 1S despite his eight cards |pg||

nt|diana_eva:  Hi Carl, welcome :)|pg||

nt|cc469: Right Simon ... it's NOT baseball :)|pg||
nt|diana_eva:  are they switching seats now?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think they play two boards and switch.  zia's table is often quick|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  The original plan was to play 46 boards, but that may have changed now, with the different numbers. |pg||
nt|cc469: some years ago when I was in Australia, I had to go to the Melbourne Casino at 10:00 a.m. Monday morning to see the Super  Bowl live.|pg||

nt|cc469: Can someone explain how these hands are devised here ... maybe an evil leprechaun in a basement makes them up?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|cc469: Constructed by someone?|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  I believe they were dealt by a hand generator, but I dont know what the precise parameters and constraints were|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|5S|mb|6D|nt|cc469: I do ... no 4333 :)|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  1NT here is meant to show 12-16 but no biddable (six card suit)|pg||
nt|pelu:  why not 4NT from W = 2 suited hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Goulash rules, dealt by computer in 364, 553 or 3334 chunks|pg||
mb|6S|mb|7D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|davisbiz:  553 is how we play goulashes at the Portland Club - about a third of the players here are from that club|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
mc|12|nt|davisbiz:  With so many voids about it is often critical which hand is on lead as to how many tricks the defence can make|pg||
nt|cc469: ok, but are the cards shuffled first?|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: In a club a Goulash happens when a board is paased oput or played at the one level|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Yes and the hands are sorted into suits and no further shuffling takes place |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: The players then sort their hands into suits , but not within suits|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  though the pack is cut once before being dealt|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Put togather into a deck - cut once then dealt in big chunks|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: I am told that running scores will be ready soon|pg||
nt|cc469: kib states that cards are dealt randomly, then sorted into suits and then dealt in chunks as others have shown|pg||
nt|cc469: a strange game ... winning action by W was to double ... how many of us would do that with his hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: PLayers moving for the next round|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  As Carl points out 7C played by East cant be defeated - all his diamonds go on the hearts after drawing trumps as South has none to lead|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  At first sight there appears to be a lot of luck involved in this version of the game, but there is a lot of skill, table presence and judgment involved - |pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Which is why when playing it for money, it is sensible to know your opponents (and partners) well|pg||

nt|davisbiz:  You wouldn't want to play against this East West at any other form of the game - Garozzo speaks for himself, and Artur Malinowski is a consistent winner at all forms of the game in London|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|davisbiz:	personally I would not rate South's hand worth 4C - the point is that if partner has any support you will hear about it, but it is often prudent to plan on all the missing trumps being in another hand until you learn otherwise|pg||

nt|davisbiz:  Still waiting for a contract to make at this table. There are six tables in all (that was the plan anyway) and each player's score is measured against the datum = average result at all six tables, rounded to the nearest hundred|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  We have had to wait a bit for the players to change round - I suspect because some participants are less used to this form of the game than others......|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  It is a pity because this formof the game can be very exciting to play and to watch - and it normally moves along pretty quickly.|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  There is quite a lot of money at stake for the winners here tonight - assuming we ever find out who they are - all the particpants have paid Â£500 to take part, and there is something like Â£10,000 in prize money at stake overall.|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  That is about $16,500 at the current exchange rate. |pg||
nt|davisbiz:  The word is that Artur Malinowski was doing very well before the dinner break but the boards we have seen here won't have helped his cause.....|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Interesting that there was only one grand slam bid before the break - it went one off - and three since the break|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Some people have asked about the bidding system - everyone is playing the same system with very few conventions allowed (no Stayman) but psychics are allowed, though I have not seen any made as yet|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  An opening one of a suit shows five good or 6 cards; 1NT 12-16 with no biddable suit (as above). 2NT natural; two of a suit strong, almost game forcing; 2C force to game.|pg||
nt|pelu:  No 2@C = a strong @c-opening :)|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Apart from doubles of opening bids and immediate responses, all doubles are for penalties - just look at the scores to see why...|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  not according to the notes Zia gave me yesterday, but he may have changed that since|pg||

nt|runnerup:  this kind of tournaments -you dont have 4. suit ... --now 8 boards and how many played home =0 |pg||
nt|davisbiz:  I did speculate that after the dinner break we might see more adventurous bidding......the truth though is that it takes time to judge how hands will play in goulashes and you are often too high too quickly|pg||
nt|runnerup:  i would say take 2 tricks off from normal bid and you have chances ..overbidding is hude here|pg||
nt|cc469: More adventurous bidding probably the result of spicy food.|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Yes you have to assume initially that a suit like South's spades will normally have two losers - even if the Queen is on your right, you often cant lead through him/her|pg||
nt|cc469: I used to often kibitz goulash games at a rubber bridge club in Florida and if a player bid 4@S with AQ108xxx his partner would come across the table screaming that that suit is ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzan: If Garozzo made one earlier, I must have been at the table.  It was a long toime ago!|pg||
nt|runnerup:  but maybe 4 @h makes finally|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Still not quite sure how many more boards to go: the original plan was 46 and we had 28 before the break, which implies another 8 to go, but still awaiting confirmation|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  3NT looks a pragmatic bid nonetheless, given the holdings in the minor suits|pg||
nt|cc469: A kib suggested earlier that this event could be more fun by issuing each player with 10 doubles per session and if they want more they can be purchased for 100 pounds each.|pg||
nt|cc469: ... tongue in cheek of course :)|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  I like that idea - it would certainly even things up a bit|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  I recall Terence Reese once working out that if he and his partner had passed throughout on every hand in a pairs tournament he wuld have had an above average score - same might well apply in this form of the game...|pg||
nt|cc469: Imagine, though, if you make a 4@S bid and your LHO waves a 100 pound note in the air and calls for the director (or whomever sells these ):)|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Yes - we used to have some players over here in the money game who just threw the notes on the table and took side bets too|pg||

nt|odysseus69: amazing - first time Marchessini did not try to declare - and the first time he should have mentioned his 9 card suit at the 6 level|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  They haven't written a textbook on playing goulashes that I have seen but it woudl read very differently to the standard one...|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  He has been playing iwth Sutart Wheeler since the 1970s or even earlier......so he knows his game by now......|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  These four players in fact are all regulars at the big money table in clubland so they have the temperament to take all this in their stride|pg||
nt|runnerup:  with 2 voids -you must pass partners opening -would have given 100% in not out |pg||
nt|davisbiz:  It will be interesting to see - if and when we see some results - how the pros have fared against the goulash regulars |pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Some of you may know that Demetri Marchessini sponsored a number of matches a few years ago between "scientists" and natural bidders to test his theory that the best natural bidders were not at a disadvantage|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  I suspect he will be hoping to show that amateurs can teach the pros a thing or two with goulashes in this event, which he helped to set up|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i expect a little disappointment|pg||

nt|davisbiz:  Now we have the owner and manager of TGRs bridge club playing together against the two Russians - interesting|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Simon, you are always a mine of xxxxx information!|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if you open lets say 7-6 -0-0- you must pass whrn your partner bid -your void suit -but noe you have a + score ,,,goulash ..not real bridge but reality|pg||

mc|9|nt|davisbiz:  I make that the fifth bid of a grand slam out of 14 hands this evening|pg||
nt|odysseus69: GB in 1/4 finals Davis Cup|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  We have had 14 hands since the break so on my calculations if we stick to the original format that leaves four more, but we know that may not be what now transpires|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Off we go again - with Zia playing with English ladyinternational Susannah Gross and Neil Mendoza playing with Christopher Kemp, two more Portland Club members|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: Just waiting for Susanna|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  A reminder that the tournament has 24 players or so competing as individuals for prize money of abouot Â£10,000, having paid an entry fee of Â£500 to take part. We are into the final stages|pg||

nt|vugraphzan: That was the last round.  Thanks for watching.  I will keep this table open for a while in case they produce the scores |pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Surprises all the way to the end - they have played 43 instead of the planned 46 - still not clear why this earlier than expected end, but no doubt we will find out in due course |pg||
nt|vugraphzan: No they played 46 ... 30 before dinner and 16 afterwards|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Ok apologies - I only saw 28 boards before dinner.....must have missed a couple (a long time ago, as you say....)|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  The original plan was for the results to be posted on www.bridgestore.co.uk but as of now they have not appeared.......but with luck they will be there tomorrow.|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  It looks like the event has concluded - we are now only waiting for the results. Individual goulash tournaments are relatively rare so I hope you have got a flavour of what can be an exciting variant on the traditional game.|pg||
mc|12|nt|vugraphzan: Leaders at the break were: Artur Malinowski with +63, Johan Upmark +38, David Barker + 34|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Artur Malinowski is the manager of TGRs bridge club in London, Johan a Swedish international and professional bridge player, David Barker one of the best amateurs - wait to see if they could keep it going to the end|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: If you want to go, full results will be up tomorrow at www.bridgehire.com|pg||
nt|davisbiz:  Thanks to Simon Cocheme for his (as always) excellent Vugraph operation - it is nothing like as easy as many of us think to keep track.  |pg||
