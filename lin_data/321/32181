nt|babs59: I imagine you or I would be opening 1H?|pg||
nt|ehaus: 5c looked quite good but for the clubs not breaking|pg||
nt|babs59: you're a sadist then Traian :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i must confess....i am...a little lol|pg||
nt|babs59: Margi Bourke reaping the benefit of Sue Lusk's auction this time!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: Pele thought for a while and passed|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|babs59: board 1 - yes - although at least EW were NV...  when my partner reopens with 2C, I would bid again if I held a penalty double|pg||

nt|babs59: no, just a slam|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: bring it on...i say|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: well last set 3 Open pairs managed to bid to 7H missing the @HA|pg||
nt|babs59: not a bad effort, I say|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: lool|pg||
nt|babs59: I suppose i should point out that none of the Women suicided on that hand :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ehaus: i thinks they will b id this ..probably to 6nt|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|babs59: I'm surprised Bourke rebid 2@D rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|ehaus: i wonder why M didn't bid 2C|pg||
nt|ehaus: snap|pg||
nt|babs59: this sort of auction - for me - shows a minimum 6-4 - whereas bidding 2@C first shows the better 6-4|pg||
nt|ehaus: i agree|pg||
nt|ehaus: 3c now is just a stopper showing|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Sue in the tank now|pg||
nt|babs59: though I do know that Rankin would bid it Bourke's way - and Tully would bid it my way|pg||
nt|babs59: (I'm going back to first names too :))|pg||
nt|babs59: 3@C for me can be a 6-4, but if so it is a weak hand - the 10-11 HCP opening bid|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: you can use first names..all profiles are rock solid|pg||
nt|ehaus: do you think showing a min 2d will scare sue off|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|babs59: I don't think so - she's usually willing to investigate - and surely at least 5m will be safe here - so there's plenty of space to explore|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ehaus: I still think Sue will think 3c is stopper and now a cue|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|babs59: I am only guessing now that 4@D was RKCB|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|babs59: and that 5@C showed 2 + Q|pg||
nt|ehaus: and 5c showed 2 with q|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: Margi looking at the bidding...|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|babs59: we are not sure of this auction - and I suspect neither of them is sure either - but they got to the right spot|pg||
pc|s2|nt|babs59: though I suspect Sue might have considered 6NT to protect her @SK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|babs59: there were two similar hands in Canberra recently - where you had to bid 6NT to protect the critical King|pg||

nt|babs59: I would have agreed with you, but not so far in the Women's|pg||
nt|babs59: I was trying to check the Open too - brb|pg||

nt|babs59: it was certainly a winning bid|pg||
nt|babs59: this VP scale is very interesting to play with too|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 12-18 the score|pg||
nt|babs59: it becomes very extreme once you are ahead or behind by 15 or so|pg||
nt|babs59: and if you are, all the 'normal' bridge odds change|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|babs59: for instance, if you are 15+ ahead, then bidding a borderline slam becomes riskier in terms of cost/benefit|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: and so risky slams now need to be 66% or better!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|babs59: whereas if you are -15 or more, then bidding borderline slams or even games becomes about 30% or so!|pg||
nt|ehaus: here we see a good balance again from Therese this time|pg||
pc|d9|nt|babs59: once you are that far behind you have little to lose and a lot of VPs to gain!|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, a nice balance but I think the double is easier than bidding a 4-carder headed by the 8|pg||
nt|ehaus: true|pg||
pc|s5|nt|babs59: and last hand Sue had to do exactly that at unfavourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|ehaus: that is what makes Sue a great player|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: i do not know how to feel about "at risk of sounding like Traian"...good or bad lol|pg||
nt|ehaus: spade suit i mean|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, and that all happened because on the @DA lead Pele signalled suit preference for spade - her @DJ|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: i decided...to feel good|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4D|nt|babs59: you were supposed to smile :)|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|babs59: Margi couldn't be sure about 5M so opted for the penalty...|pg||
nt|babs59: this is an auction where one leads a trump --- if you have one |pg||
nt|babs59: to stop any ruffs |pg||

nt|ehaus: good result for ew due to the preempt|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|d3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|babs59: I think this should fail by one trick because East needs to trump spades, which means that she cannot also pick up the trump suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|babs59: although she could now establish the club suit if she leads the CQ next|pg||
