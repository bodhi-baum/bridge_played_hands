pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: does 3@C bid imply a hand that wanted to punish 1@S?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: question  2:  what would 2@S mean instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|frankaus: better hand i expect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: question  3:  how strong can Klinger be to re-open with a mere 2@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2@s by south would have been a good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those questions are my way of  trying to talk myself out of 2@C-PASS  but i'm having a very hard time doing that|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@C prob F |pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2@c by North pretty well showed a weak hand with 55 shape|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: 2@C forcing???   no way   just very suit oriented and likely 0@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a hand that does not want partner to convert reopening DBL to penalty|pg||

nt|frankaus: S not worth 15 by my assessment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction from Bilski-Brown|pg||
nt|ahollan1: step 1 -- Bilski treating his 64 as single suiter|pg||
nt|frankaus: red light attacts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: step 2   Brown upgrading hand with known fit|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Interesting that Bilski counts his hand as one Major only|pg||

nt|frankaus: 6-4 is a sigle suiter to most |pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i.e. if you don't open a 5-card major you don't have one|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: Peake has a good immagination - - dangerous as an opponent|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Bilski smells the rat taht the bidding suggests and Passes|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Peake  is such an agressive bidder that many play only penalty dbls against him!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: only one card from Bilski will beat now|pg||
