nt|r_tibre: are Hooda and Puneet playing prec or std?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rv: I suspect precision since Hooda prefers strong @c based system|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|r_tibre: not a great slam to be in|pg||
nt|rv: yes need @h break, @DK inside and a bit more|pg||
nt|r_tibre: 2@S maybe either investigating slam, or reaching the right game if they raise with 3 cards as well|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: 2@s is possibly played as relay here, Manas da might want to show max with stiff @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|r_tibre: change the @SK to @DK, and i will certainly explore|pg||
