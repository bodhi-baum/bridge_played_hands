nt|vugrapha1: NS can make 4H , EW a lot of Spades|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|tejjyid: 4@D - show the singleton? |pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's overstating the hand a bit, but less seems too tame|pg||
nt|sybarra: or do you just bid 4 @H and give nothing away?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tejjyid: right, tough board to start with|pg||
