nt|vugrapha1: before that board EW were up 16.7 to 3.3 VPs|pg||
mb|1N|nt|frankaus: 14-14|pg||
nt|babs59: someone else failed - in 4@S - which will help them a little|pg||
nt|frankaus: 14-16|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Lazer doesnt upgrade his 14-16 NT bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: very interesting scoring scale here |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fugitiv: whoa that is good 16 points|pg||
pc|h2|nt|babs59: once you are ahead by 15+ IMPs  it changes the odds of close games and slams|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: true, but it depends on what the field is doing right?|pg||
nt|babs59: to bid 'risky' contracts you need the odds to be around 66% by my calculations - cos you risk a lot of VPs|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|babs59: not really - I suspect the 8 board WBF VP scale for 10 board matches is flawed|pg||
pc|h7|nt|frankaus: if this rolls in it will help resurect the ship|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|babs59: and if you are 15+ IMPs down, the cost/benefit factor changes your risk factor in your favour too|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: lots of decisions ahead for declarer|pg||
nt|babs59: so then game and slams only have to be about 30% - you are losing by so much already but you risk getting back to equal|pg||
nt|babs59: I think that last board emphasised that, significantly - tho it wasn't a great slam by any means|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yeah if you're ahead you want to stick to what the field is doing|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: if the field was in slam it would be risky to stay out of it|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, but the spread of the VPs once 15 or more changes the risk a lot - so if ahead play safe, if behind you can take way more risk than even usually|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: If you are down in a match, the odds now with the new VP scale, favour bidding a vul game with 4% less prob.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ie. assuming your oppoenents dont bid it|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter that might be the case in a team match, where it is head to head|pg||
nt|babs59: with Butler Pairs I'm sure different elements have to be factored in, such as the other pairs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: That is true; the new scales were not really designed for Butler scoring|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Not sure if declarer knows hearts are 4-4 here, as Griff returned the 7 (deceptively?) on the 2nd round |pg||
nt|babs59: I'm sure the WBF scale was designed with TEAMS in mind, not with Butler Pairs scoring|pg||
nt|babs59: snap|pg||
nt|babs59: well, perhaps as one of the designers, you should tell the ABF that so that they could investigate a 'better' method for Butler Pairs?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: The WBF are looking into how Butler scoring should be VP'd|pg||
nt|babs59: good|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugrapha1: The wheels of progress turn slowly with thhe WBF|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: not sure what posessed Griff to play a spade here, maybe he wants to play some mind games with declarer|pg||
nt|babs59: this wasn't a wise return|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: although a heart endplays partner|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: he had to find a diamond|pg||
nt|babs59: so a @D would be a good idea?|pg||
