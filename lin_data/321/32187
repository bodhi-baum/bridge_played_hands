nt|babs59: oh, that's Howard Melbourne and Joe Haffer (8th) :)|pg||
nt|babs59: my brother Peter (Gill) is 3rd|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|babs59: 4@S seems to hinge on the trump guess, but there is a way to defeat it regardless|pg||
nt|babs59: club lead - to @CA, club back to @CK, another club|pg||
nt|babs59: rise @SA and give partner a trump promotion|pg||
nt|babs59: with the 4th club|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: That would be great to see|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|vugrapha1: 3@c = limit raise in Spades|pg||
nt|babs59: of course now there is little prospect on the club lead|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: 3@h  only game try|pg||
nt|babs59: at the same time, it may have reduced the prospect of guessing the spade correctly I suppose|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: declarer might even play for West to have spade length?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|babs59: 3rd and 5th leads |pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|babs59: I think he'll try the @CA next|pg||
nt|babs59: in order to get a signal from partner|pg||
nt|babs59: Howard is a very thoughtful player, esp at defence - thinks a lot|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|babs59: they play transfers over 1@C openings|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 1@s = diamonds|pg||
nt|babs59: 1@S shows diamonds I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|babs59: puppet to 2@D|pg||
nt|babs59: 2@C either transfers to diamonds or has invitational options (not this hand)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: I think Haffer is now trying to remember system|pg||
nt|babs59: he needs more bananas|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: enlightenment!|pg||
nt|babs59: all I can say is, lucky they have screens :)|pg||
nt|babs59: Howard would be shaking his head if he thought Joe was struggling with system|pg||
nt|babs59: (he probably is anyway)|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: no he is answering enumerable questions from Gill|pg||
nt|babs59: so anyway, Joe Haffer loves to eat bananas...|pg||
nt|babs59: and also lebanese cucumbers at the table, I gather?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: others are adding (about Joe's eating habits at the table):  snow peas, carrots, whatever's crunchy|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: they tried to get them to game|pg||
nt|babs59: hmm, yes, bananas are NOT crunchy :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugrapha1: Matthew will need to do some good guessing here|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|babs59: I think the lead marks the @CKQ|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|babs59: and I think the opening probably marks the only option for the hearts - @HA with West|pg||
nt|babs59: but this is an effective opening lead|pg||
nt|babs59: diamond back to Melbourne, then another club through|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Yes, but who has the J@h ?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: more questions on the Gill-Haffer side of screen|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Yes they are playing with screens for all BBO matches only|pg||

mb|p|nt|ehaus: y|pg||
mb|1S|nt|babs59: Joe had to return a trump at when he won the HA - not difficult to see with dummy on display|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ehaus: no contract in game looks any good here|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|babs59: ah yes - that @S10 at trick 1 was overkill for the defence - the S9 could then be established|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehaus: 4h is probably best on paper but not with the 4 - 1 break|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: 2NT was artificial game force|pg||
pc|cT|nt|babs59: 2NT must have been game forcing and 3D a transfer|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ehaus: maybe declrer can make now aD was not cashed due to spade hook|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|babs59: Gill has to decide who has the SK though - a finesse or a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|ehaus: Peter had to take spade finesse to pitch diamond i think|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, but he didn't know the hearts were breaking badly|pg||

mb|2D|mb|4S|nt|ehaus: 5c is a good contract here|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|babs59: indeed, can they now reach it?|pg||
nt|ehaus: why not?|pg||
nt|babs59: will Matthew think it's best to defend with 3 aces - rather than risk only an 8-card fit at the 5-level (unwise)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ehaus: the vulnerability was toooo good|pg||
nt|babs59: if Peter only held 4 clubs then the Law says to defend is better|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Might have been better to play 4@s doubled|pg||
nt|babs59: which way?  EW vul :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|ehaus: but he could never X which is the best score|pg||
nt|babs59: so 4SX would be 800|pg||
pc|sK|nt|babs59: Peter had doubled tho|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ehaus: i mean sit the double ...would you|pg||
nt|babs59: so defending would be right here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c2|nt|babs59: I would with Howard opposite|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
nt|babs59: and I would have to say that if I had bid 5C in the qualifying it was wrong!|pg||

nt|babs59: (opposite Howard I would pass - means that he would tell me 2 things if I bid - 1. I broke The Law, 2. take the positive|pg||
mb|p|nt|babs59: )     and I'd add - notice the vulnerability (at teams scoring)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ehaus: what did you mean by that as 4S was a gross overbid|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|babs59: no - I meant that 5C would be the problem bid|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: 4@s was a dream: 3NT was 50%|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|babs59: everyone nowadays is opening 1NT with 5-2-2-4s but I'm not really sure why|pg||
pc|s6|nt|babs59: and 4-2-2-5s|pg||
nt|babs59: you always have ready rebids|pg||
nt|babs59: on the other hand, 2-4-2-5 is different|pg||
pc|s3|nt|babs59: I have an explanation - when you don't open 1NT you have a shortage - but I'd rather be in 4S sometimes when it's a better contract|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|babs59: it's TEAMS scoring where safety of the contract is paramount|pg||
