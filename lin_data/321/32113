nt|vugrapha2: 5NT described as pick a slam. Both E&W shrugged at their final bids|pg||
nt|Henryb:  a heart lead gives declarer the most trouble|pg||
nt|petergill: Pablo Lambardi, having vast experience in inexperienced partnerships, found the excellent practical 5NT jump in order to make the bidding easier|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Henryb:  On any other he can ruff a club and claim|pg||

nt|Fugitiv: yes the set is finishing well for them|pg||
nt|bebechira: they scored 50 in the last boards|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: this one could have been better in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think Milne led 32-0 after 2 or 3 boards of this match - on one of the first 3 boards, Burgess splintered and Lorentz, who likes natural bids, passed it|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bebechira: 42 ok lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: seems like 50|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: 32 after 2 boards would have been a good start|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: as would 32 after 3 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D - 5@D perhaps now?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|serhat: lets see|pg||
nt|babs59: it was 32-0 after 3 boards this morning, Paul|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S (over 2!FD) good raise of @D by South is the alternative|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: Milne really came out firing then|pg||
nt|serhat: I dont think he has enough for 5D Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: South's 1NT denies 4 spades, so 2@S on 2nd bid is good raise (= Standard bidding)|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: could bid 3s|pg||
nt|serhat: may be 4d pass pass pass , my guess|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: that will get them there|pg||
nt|babs59: would you bid 2@S over 2@D as a good raise?	I usually have better diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@S now? |pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yeah if it shows good spades you've certainly got that|pg||
nt|babs59: 3@S now would be effective|pg||
nt|serhat: perfect fit|pg||
nt|babs59: it might even get them to 6@D?|pg||
nt|serhat: can make 6 on a good day|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S, trying to show his shape   ...  over 3@S ---> 5@D by South, or 4@S slam try?|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: surely Edgtton is worth some sort of try, with slam on a finesse|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|babs59: tho, admittedly, there are plenty of 3@D raise hands which are NOT perfect|pg||
nt|serhat: he knows partner doesnt have more than 3 @S |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: A 1H - 1NT - 2@D - 2@S bid would be more like Axx, Kx, Kxxxx, xxx - i.e. really huge|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|petergill: South has taken 3@S as a stopper ask|pg||
nt|serhat: things got complicated|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: mmm|pg||
nt|petergill: Oops, will North pass|pg||
nt|babs59: I agree Peter.  The times I've bid it (actually partner more than me) we seem to have a singleton in the 1-Major suit too|pg||
nt|petergill: I think not - if 3Nt was right, South would have bid 2NT over 2@S, so North removes|pg||
nt|petergill: ovcer 2@D I mean|pg||
mb|5D|nt|babs59: I'm not sure they are on the same page this auction - 3NT doesn't make sense if North's 3@S showed shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Tough decision for South now|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done|pg||
nt|serhat: normally he should pass as he bid his top of his limit. but he might work it out 3S was asking now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|serhat: yes wd|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Playing a limited opening system (Precision), Burgess could surely have jumped to 3@d over 1NT at other table|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: oh yeah, he couldn't be much stronger for 1h then|pg||
nt|babs59: is this second round of trumps wise?|pg||
nt|serhat: he better careful for the line|pg||
nt|petergill: Serhat's point, that when North removed 3NT, South now re-evaluated what North had - is correct|pg||
nt|petergill: North might run out of entries to N hand and go down|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: yeah he's in trouble|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: will end up losing a club trick|pg||
nt|Fugitiv: on repeated club leads|pg||
nt|serhat: yes -1 now|pg||
nt|babs59: Burgess had fewer play problems on a trump lead (not shortened)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have had 16 days in a row of bridge - Andy Hung convening the Youth Week which is even harder than playing|pg||
nt|babs59: not quite 16 days - Adam Edgtton managed to get the weekend off between events|pg||
nt|serhat: Adam might ask for a undo if Lambardi hesitates little longer!:)|pg||
nt|serhat: an undo|pg||
nt|petergill: Pablo Lambardi correctly deduced that shortening N's trumps was a better chance than a trump lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|babs59: because he won the Youth event - for the Australian U25 team|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|serhat: E ;better take and play a @C |pg||
nt|petergill: Best is to set up the side suit first, asis so often the case - he should then survive on crossruff lines|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|d8|pg||
