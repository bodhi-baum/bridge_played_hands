nt|r_tibre: 28 turned out to be a flat.. but 29 costs 7 for the 1@S-3@S-4@S auction|pg||
nt|thak: yes, it's possible, I'm sure none of us will ever do it. But considering it from "The Law" point of view, pass does have some merit|pg||

nt|rv:	Hi Sudis, Sandeep and all specs, Hemant Jalan up by 38 over Maya Meera after 2 sets in other SFs|pg||
nt|rv:	Sudip|pg||
nt|thak: Hi RV, welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzbn: hi all|pg||
nt|thak: Formidables has an uphill battle at their hands here|pg||
nt|rv:	Sree Priya leading by 22 here over fancied Formidables in other SFs here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|thak: Satya sets the ball rolling with a light NT opening|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv:  Sree Priya is primarily CV Rao team members, they have a very interesting policy, they let any sponsor hire the full team|pg||
nt|rv:	sponsor has to typically hire any 4 out of Badal, Chotan, Chandu, Kachchu and Sadhu|pg||
nt|thak: likely to land in 4@S in short order, unless Aloke falls in love with his minor 2 suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: or 5, in which case one plays with the sponsor|pg||
nt|rv:	this model works well for the players involved as well as sponsors|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: pass here denies a @C check, or shows long @Cs|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|thak: Rdbl continues the stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak: though perhaps transfer stayman more appropriate|pg||
nt|rv:	Aloke Sadhu is growing old, normally he would have a lot more than just double of 2@c|pg||
nt|thak: since NT opener has stated that he doesn't have anything to protect|pg||
nt|thak: and so any honors in responder's hand should be protected|pg||
nt|rv:	possibly colors dissuaded him|pg||
mb|3C|nt|r_tibre: hi all|pg||
nt|rv:	gm Rajesh|pg||
nt|thak: Subhash here considering whether this 2@S actually shows @Hs|pg||
nt|r_tibre: gm RV|pg||

mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|rv:  Formidables won a close match vs one of the pre-tourney favorites DSM in clash of the heavyweights in QFs|pg||
nt|rv:	Sree Priya topped swiss league and won fairly easy match vs Kishan's IV in QFs, they had choice of picking up any opp from 5-8|pg||
nt|rv:	Formidables won by 7 IMPs vs DSM |pg||
nt|r_tibre: is 3@S a slam try now?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|thak: let me correct you there  - Sree Priya won against N Chakraborty's|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thak: Maya Meera won against Kisan|pg||
nt|rv:	in other SFs, Jalan leading by 38 after 2 sets vs Maya Meera Sneha|pg||
nt|rv:	thanks Sandeep|pg||
pc|cT|nt|thak: landed on their feet..|pg||
nt|rv:	Sandeep who is key member of Jalan is missing this tourney and he has ably replaced by Ashok Vaidya who is partnering Bendre|pg||
nt|rv:	Jalan comprise of Hemant Jalan-Ashish Malhotra, Kaustabh Nandi-Sandip Dutta, Kaustubh Bendre-Ashok Vaidya|pg||
nt|thak: should be 4 easy tricks for defence, in the form of 1 each suit|pg||
nt|r_tibre: maybe another 5 imps to leaders|pg||
nt|rv:	this is not regular Formidables, Keyzad partnering J.MShah instead of his regular partner Sunit Chokshi|pg||
nt|rv:	Satya partnering Guruji (Subhash Gupta) instead of his regular partner Kiran Nadar|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|thak: and Tiwari-Prabhakar missing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv:	Sadhu did very well to rein his aggressive instincts here, 3m double will be quite messy|pg||
nt|r_tibre: if W opens 1@D, do u make a game try as E?|pg||
nt|rv:	I won't be surprised if South in CR bids a bit more and gets into trouble|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|thak: especially with @H suit, idea is to get in early. Sit back with @S suit|pg||
