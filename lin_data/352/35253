mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think he is right -- wins a lot if either contract takes 11 tricks, loses only if neither make and then doesn't lose as much.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: from Kit's former partner	http://www.bridgeace.com/lessons/BOLS/1987_Manfield_Five_Level.pdf|pg||

pc|s3|nt|kit: Declarer will win 2nd round of trumps, heart finesse, ace of hearts, heart ruff, and run trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Would make on squeeze if North has 4 hearts and the king of clubs|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|jbgood:  ... but S did have to have something for his opener...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kit: South could have ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood:  right|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: just checked their  CC    NS use Rusinow leads at 5+ level   so @DK did [ostensibly] show the Ace|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: but easy to imagine case where @DK from K-empty   [just not KQ]|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer thinks South has the king of hearts he may (wrongly) play for a squeeze end-play trying to go down 1.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: oy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: oh my -- now declareer can make|pg||
nt|jbgood:  yes - the @h 2 is on the table|pg||
nt|kit: Seems like South should have discarded a small diamond, making it clear where the king of clubs is|pg||
nt|kit: But if declarer has king of clubs he has 11 top tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|dA|pc|c3|pc|d3|pg||

nt|ritong: on the other hand he is aiming at making exactly eight tricks when he passes 2NT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT is very close to making -- after spade and a spade (ducked), declarer can play a third spade and force defense to correct count|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||

nt|jbgood:  brief break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we'll definitely have a first-time winner this year|pg||
nt|kit: the point is, if it is our hand partner won't be quitting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only previous winners of Cavendish Pair in the field are the 2013 winners   Nanev-Gunev  who failed to make it into Group A|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - is the split into multiple flights something that started with Monaco hosting the event?|pg||
nt|kit: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of that innovation?|pg||
nt|kit: in Vegas, was a straight play through|pg||
nt|kit: I think it is a good idea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: were any of your wins in New York - or all Vegas|pg||
nt|kit: Problem with old way was in final session you had pairs completely out of it playing the leaders and not really caring|pg||
nt|kit: first was in NY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here within each flight multiple there are cash prizes for each session as well as overall|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pretty good structure to maximize each pair playing its best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen the prize structure for this year -- but i haven't read all of the Daily Bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which are located under   http://www.cavendishmonaco.com/index.php?lang=en|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another question for Kit --  do you think we'll ever see the originally intended alternating schedule of this event in Monaco one year then somewhere in USA the next?|pg||
nt|kit: I'll believe it when it happens|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that seems to be the consensus|pg||
nt|ritong: while we are waiting, would it be possible to correct +90 in +110 on board 10?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: boards 10 & 11   w:Piedra n:Buras e:Lantaron s:Narkiewicz|pg||
nt|ritong: losing three trumps and @d A, unless i miss something|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Henri -  web page also shows result as 110|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but movie sure suggest +130|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh   you were asking 90 vs 110    now i get it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  losing 4 tricks is 110    makes more sense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just a reminder to everyone that BBO results are UNOFFICIAL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no daily bulletin seems to describe the prize structure  and i'm unable to find that information on the web page|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but latest bulletin does describe the algorithm for calculating the carryover|pg||
