nt|petergill: The last time I played in the Cavendish, each table had its own little "cubicle" surrounded by curtains, for security reasons|pg||
nt|petergill: when you finished each 3 bd round, each pair went to the foyer, so that post mortems could not be overheard|pg||
nt|petergill: This was in Las Vegas. As a result, between rounds in the foyer, I got to meet many legendary wonderful bridge personalities such as Paul Soloway|pg||

nt|petergill: One two board round to go. We await the move. |pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot get the Cavendish website to open. An hour ago, Dana and Noga Tal led narrowly from Michielsen - Mortel and Sarniak - Baldysz. |pg||
nt|petergill: the B Final was led by Fiona Brown and Sally Brock, an hour ago|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Open Final Buras Narkiewicz had a big lead, from Robson - Forrester|pg||
nt|petergill: in the Open Plate, I think Fantunes had taken the lead. |pg||
nt|petergill: Pairs who did not qulify for the Open Final include Helgemo - Helness, Fantunes, Nanev - Gunev (who won last year), Bessis - Delmonte and Gromov - Dubinin.  |pg||

nt|petergill: At matchpts, a vul game should be bid if 50%. At Teams , about 36%. At IMP Pairs with Butler scoring, about 30%. At Cavendish IMP Pairs, about 36%.  |pg||
nt|petergill: this auction put paid to the idea of EW bidding their thin game|pg||

nt|petergill: minus 300 is no bargain when EW are so unlikely to bid to 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: North did bid 4@h with some hope of making it, but Both Vul makes the cost high when failing|pg||
