nt|ahollan1: i think he would be squeezed in 3 suits|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, so he would|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would be fun too	 when was last [or even first] time you saw a defensive triple squeeze against partner|pg||
nt|patricck: substitute the word Homicidal for defensive and it is even better :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|jbgood:  not sure about how the di ten would have been read by W |pg||
nt|chmitty: maybe East should have played the 10 ? but if that denies the J, then West might cash a second @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: these situations have to be discussed again and again by top pairs ...|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chmitty: a card can be a count, a preference, a forcing card, etc ... you have to discuss all situations|pg||
nt|jbgood:  perhaps the most vital point is E's 5 @d bid - often shows a good fit? so 4?|pg||
nt|chmitty: kibs point out that many pairs lead King from AK when they want to switch to a singleton in a side suit|pg||
