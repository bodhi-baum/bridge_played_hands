mb|1S|nt|chmitty: other room in 5@cx so more Imps to Eidi at the start of this match|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty friendly hand|pg||
nt|kit: I think East will just shoot out game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: might splinter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if that is unassuming|pg||

mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: 1S bid improves his hand a bit as dummy so all side suits likely have controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldn;t be for me, but so many people play them as limited courtesy bids these days|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|kit: I just don't think it pays to stop in 3@H vulnerable with a hand such as this -- risking 10 IMPs to win 6, and you win those 6 only if there are exactly 9 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: when you can't judge how well the hands mesh|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jbgood:  2 NT almost never natural these days after a major opener|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: In other room East did bid 4@H, so the hand will be decided there.|pg||
nt|chmitty: depending on the defence, West might have a chance to play the Queen of @s and see South's reaction ...|pg||
nt|chmitty: can't ruff without revealing the trump situation|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: i think Michel has been there before, and wouldnt ruff with any holding. chances that W needs that pitch are miniscule|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chmitty: and not ruffing with 2 small @h is maybe routine at this level ... but still :)|pg||
nt|kit: He can tell by looking at dummy that it isn't a question of quick diamond pitches|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chmitty: I agree with both of you ... but does not cost and is just a bit of fun at the table :)|pg||

nt|chmitty: for results of the 6th round|pg||
nt|kit: South might have redoubled to show that he has a good overcall without committing to the 2-level.|pg||
nt|chmitty: top four qualify after this last round robin match for 1/2 finals|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: French style tends to be more conservative, though the second-generation Bessis sitting N might well have done that :)|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3S|mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|kit: Now opponents have a chance to find their save, as they have had the opportunity to locate a fit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood:  tthis time they saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And now Sout has no idea what to do -- he doesn't even know if he can beat 5@H|pg||
nt|chmitty: but at least Michel knows he can't make 5@s (his partner can't have 2 aces)|pg||
nt|kit: Probably North should have doubled, holding an ace and the QJ of clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: It certainly looks like 4S to me facing a PH|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: but again, the french are conservative in general, so it would perhaps be common to pass 3 bare aces at these colours|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting situation to discuss in the partnership : North will say that he can't know whether QJ@c are defensive values or not|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|chmitty: and will suggest South bids 4@d instead of 4@s|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chmitty: South will argue that 4@d might encourage the partner to bid at the 5 level, which is not what you like him to do|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: yes, especially at these colors where EW are so likely to save, 4D could be very helpful. On the other hand, it might well establish a Forcing Pass and perhaps S did not care to do ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but as Kit has said, starting with 4S eliminates a lot of problems (though you are pretty strong for the bid at these colors so your side still might have the last guess and go ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wrong  --  but that could happen no matter what you do)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|chmitty: as NS are playing 4@s next door, it's an 11 Imps loss instead of 8 only ...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: without knowing full set of NS understandings, it is of course difficult to assess the 2S call. presumably it was a matter of system rather than judgment|pg||
