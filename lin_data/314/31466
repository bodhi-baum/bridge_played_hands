nt|chorush: It can be made but it would help to see all the cards|pg||
nt|ady: maybe not   because spades 5-2|pg||
nt|meargent: it seemed a waste to Z to take so many bids for so long and only bid 6|pg||
nt|ady: declarer can take ruffing finesse in diamonds	 but cant alsoenjoy the 3 spade tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Trump should be led ?|pg||
nt|ady: I think we will have new leaders after this hand|pg||

nt|meargent: hell i didnt think there was anyway it could bid so i will wait to see|pg||
nt|meargent: could be bid|pg||
nt|reisig: Isn't a trump lead...kinda automatic?|pg||
nt|ady: without a diamond lead	declarer might just draw trumps   and hope for J@S to come down in 3	 if not finesse in hearts|pg||
nt|meargent: as long as east doesnt lead an honour def should prevail|pg||
nt|reisig: 70 years ago ...some guy said .."against grands" - lead a trump!|pg||
nt|chorush: that was before people started bidding them off the trump Q|pg||
nt|meargent: the only trump honour im off in a GS is the ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Since this hand started last year, we've gained 250 kibitzers :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe ...the hold-up is--- who is the declarer :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Still thinking in East|pg||
nt|chorush: Perhaps the length of the auction has induced a coma|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Director at table|pg||
nt|reisig: If the lead is NOT @C 4 (or 8) ...I'd fired him|pg||
nt|chorush: I was a young man when this hand appeared on the screen|pg||
nt|meargent: maybe east really is in a coma?|pg||
nt|meargent: that could explain the dirctor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Lead is now face down, Miller asking questions with Director at table, issues bein discussed|pg||
