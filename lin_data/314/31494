nt|kit: Still, all declarer has is 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, and 1 spade for sure|pg||

nt|kit: Martel wondring whether to win this, as he won't have an easy exit if he does|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kit: But ducking is more dangerous, as defense needs the tricks they can take|pg||
nt|kit: kibs suggesting declarer should have gone up queen of diamonds.  That would be pretty silly if opening lead was from K10xx.|pg||
nt|kit: West's heart 6 discard is very difficult to read I think.|pg||
nt|kit: East knows declarer is either 2-3-5-3 or 2-2-5-4|pg||
nt|kit: I think he can infer 2-2-5-4 since West didn't discard a club from 5, which makes a heart shift right.|pg||
nt|kit: And if he does shift to a heart, he should put down the ace to get some clarification.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: Martel pondering deeply|pg||
nt|kit: If he shifts toa club, declarer has the spots to pick up the club suit -- except for the blockage.|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: A club guess in 3NT here could be critical to the result score|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: NS  do NOT play Smith|pg||
nt|jkdood: NS have the defensive tempo from @S opening lead, so giving up lead twice (@H and @C) is damaging|pg||
nt|jkdood: The long @S has plenty of entires it seems as well, so hold-up plays dont seem to help much|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in many versions of bbo  you can click on player name to get link to convention card, player info, etc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but not all versions  and not all players have links to cc|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: The juniors lost the second board|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Fleisher started the set 4.25 behind leaders Zimmermann   tied 2/3 with the multi-national Gromov team|pg||

pc|h4|pc|s6|mc|8|nt|ahollan1: at this table - new players after every set of 3 boards|pg||
nt|jkdood: The redouble might have shown Souths @H @S length (as equal) so that was another piece of info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at one table  Sontag-Berkowitz are stationary NS	 at another  Grue-Moss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: those tables don't have real comparisons|pg||
nt|jkdood: With clubs potentially guessable, looks like Fleisher team have a slight edge on this last result|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 minutes on the clock  only a couple of tables have finished|pg||
nt|jkdood: NS are on Fleisher team, tied for 2nd 3rd, .66 ahead of the EW team here, 4th at the start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all tables play same boards at same time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with a slight delay  scores are posted ala Barometer|pg||
nt|jkdood: And ZIA MArtel did very well this last board (+690) so the Fleisher team with 4.75 boards to gain, is off to a good start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but historically no updates toward the end |pg||
nt|jkdood: They WON 2 and TIED 1, for 2.50 added to their score. The Swedes get 0.50 total for the round.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure if last update is round 5 or round 7	[of 9]|pg||
nt|jkdood: Standings can be viewed at http://www.usbf.org/|pg||
nt|jkdood: As AL points out, the players see where they satnd after most of the rounds, and some will seek swings with offbeat actions accordingly, for much drama or excitement|pg||
nt|jkdood: where they STAND|pg||
nt|jkdood: The Swedes in 4th were 2.34 ahead of 5th, so might remain 4th despite an unfortunate round to start|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd round has been called|pg||
nt|jkdood: Martel played 3NT on the third board, and did run hearts before guessing clubs, going with restricted choice.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the linked 2 tables of real comparisons should always be one of the top 3 teams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're getting fantunes now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  verhees-van prooijen|pg||
nt|jkdood: Restricted choice basically is when South has a chocie of either honor with QJ doubleton, he tends not to have the "other one" he showed because of the choice.  Sort of subtle but ...|pg||
nt|jkdood: well-respected theory.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: LOTS of alerts|pg||
nt|jkdood: NS were the leaders to start this segment (Zimmerman), EW were in 5th (Zagorin team)|pg||
nt|pmasson:  Not just a theory, but a principle based in math|pg||

mc|12|nt|Vugraphzfj: Short break while other tables finish|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: All 10 tables must be done before the next set can start, a classic "barometer" movement where all table play the same 3 boards|pg||
nt|meargent: in other room west opened 1nt then rosenberg had to show his majours so declarer got the @Cs wrong|pg||

nt|pmasson:  lol|pg||
nt|jkdood: South did well to hide @Ds, West is not likely to find @D @D lead/play as much|pg||
nt|pmasson:  There is something to be said for cashing aces at BAM though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember  this is essentially matchpoints	 so @DA lead is NOT outrageous|pg||
nt|Chick: any other lead and it's ice cold, since 2 diamonds go away on spade and club|pg||
nt|jkdood: So 6@h in the replay with a different lead, or a double, are all possible|pg||
nt|Chick: actually, the @DA is a good lead, since W can at least hope for a trick with his 5 hearts|pg||
nt|jkdood: But when there are iffy choices, leading your partners bid suit, even in this auction, is sometimes best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: motivation for @DA more likely to be -- it could go away on north's black suit winners|pg||

nt|jkdood: 3.58 gap(4 boards) with 6 to go... very tough|pg||
nt|jkdood: NS showed diamonds in other room, so lead was perhaps somewhat (or much) easier|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fleisher only scored 0.5 this set	 and we saw zimmerman did well|pg||
nt|pmasson:  In the old days, you needed to win by .25|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scores get posted to  www.usbf.org|pg||

nt|pmasson:  Madala also led the @DA against Sontag|pg||
nt|jkdood: So if you are 3 or 4 boards behind, in 2nd or 3rd, with 6 boards to go, do you alter your tactics?|pg||
nt|jkdood: If you are on a sponsored team, and there is abonus for 2nd finish, that could be a factor. But some VERY top players are messaging me: YES|pg||
