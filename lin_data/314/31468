nt|Vugraphzfc: Passell complimented Bramley earlier on his bidding the 3rd Quarter|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: There will probably be very little pauses for overtricks on hands where they are possible|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: Should have tried 3NT for a swing?|pg||
nt|jkdood: So any specs that note "could have made another" the players just wanted to move on|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jkdood: Maybe the plan is for this NS to "play straight" and the Poles to find the diversions?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Not that a "real" plan is allowed, but I think players know who will swing and who will likely swing "less"|pg||
nt|jkdood: We did see "diversions" last quarter from both pairs, they just have to be winning ones this time ;-)|pg||
