nt|smoller:  why does Wesr waste a round of bidding, when he does not try to find out anthing, anyway? :)|pg||
nt|athene: well west obviously thought north's 5@D, and hamman's pass over 5@D made the grand a better better|pg||
nt|athene: he thought those two things together made it extremely unlikely hamman had any wasted values in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass is not encouraging.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner only committed to game, not the 5-level.|pg||
nt|athene: there's no double squeeze around clubs|pg||
nt|athene: or around anything else :)|pg||

nt|athene: north just sits there looking at his splendid @S9 and chuckling|pg||
nt|athene: her @S9 even|pg||

nt|athene: the idea being that if she had the @DJ the contract would be safe anyway if spades were 3-3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
mc|7|nt|athene: but that asks for too many specific things to happen elsewhere|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|smoller:  this limits his losers to 2 @C|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess with west showing 5-5 at least in the minors, you don't really know the @HK is any use, and if a double tipped declarer off to your trump holding - could be very costly|pg||
