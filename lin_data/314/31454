mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2N game force raise that includes singleton splinters|pg||

nt|ahollan1: doesn't apply here - but curious piece of trivia that NS codify immediate splinters for VOIDS|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|jkdood: Do they play mini-splinters then for normal type?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@C = void in other major|pg||
nt|jkdood: AK (@H) is still 2 tricks, so should keep bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if there are any inferences about quick losers/controls in the unbid suits when making this void-showing bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i.e.  is Bramley worried about possible 2 quick losers in @C|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: if his pard has an opener and no hearts, shouldnt worry him that much|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|jkdood: And onward and upward|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H showing @C control??  not needed to say anything about @H   but another possibility is Last Train|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C = 0/3 keycards|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jkdood: Last train (means for specs) - when there is just one bid available below game, cue that with any holding to show slam interest remains high|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jkdood: so hearts could even be xxx|pg||
