pc|s8|nt|jkdood: Kasle made the extra overtrick 2@S +4, so versus his opponents he may also do quite well|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkdood: A win is a win :)  870 versus 140 or 170 versus 140. Hardly seems fair|pg||

nt|jkdood: Making 4 or making 5?|pg||
nt|jkdood: There could be some pressure late, but 10 tricks seem most likely|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Little for ZIA to work  with, but he does|pg||

nt|jkdood: Some think East could try 1@D or something, others want West to bid. But combined with their silence and ZIA's flair, a spot was missed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: last time i saw Peter Rank -- he was playing with Barry Crane|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: so i was wondering   what would Crane do over 1@C|pg||
nt|jkdood: Martel could go down probably 3 (-150) and have a likely win - more if EW teammates find the 4@S game|pg||
nt|pelu:  4@s bid in our phamtom room|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: in case you're counting	that was 1975|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jkdood: SO wise choice by Zia, as he allows spades innto the picture, not that West will sell low|pg||
