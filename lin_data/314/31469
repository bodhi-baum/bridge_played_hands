mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Henryb:  If I were S I would assume that partner knows I don't have zero KC for an opening bid and a slam try|pg||

nt|kvzacc: yeah 6cl can be a solution|pg||

nt|karesz: why?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Once North bids 5@h I don't believe you can bid the grand|pg||
nt|granguru:  RKCB as Kantar defined it 5@H is to pass with 0 and to show @HQ and K with 3|pg||
nt|kvzacc: north really shouldn't bid 5h, it's impossible to miss 3 keycards|pg||
nt|granguru:  thats why 1430 was invented|pg||
nt|karesz: North bid 5 @H beacuse South can have 0 aces...|pg||
