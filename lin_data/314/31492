nt|nilsland:  I dont know if Souths pass over 5@C was forcing, but I guess it was - and then he must trust his partner|pg||
nt|jkdood: EW were not "super clearly sacrificing" with 5@C, East being unpassed hand. So some play FP is OFF when that happens if no cue bid earlier setting up a Forcing Pass|pg||
nt|jkdood: North might have had singleton @S K for 4@S, so South realy had what I think is impossible problem|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It is one area where you have to have agreements|pg||
nt|nilsland:  North might have raised to 4S by bidding 4H to show a "good raise"|pg||
nt|jkdood: Our phantom/virtual replay pair got to 5@S, +680, reinforcing what looks like a win for Gordon vs this NS|pg||
nt|nilsland:  which would give South a clear 5H bid in my view|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes, North can "create a FP" with a strong call like that, and its not clearly a slam try in many partnerships, just a "hint"|pg||
nt|jkdood: The top world players discuss these issues in great detail; its especially difficult when N is a passed hand, but the cue still could create a FP by North|pg||
nt|nilsland:  when you are a passed hand it is often easier to find bids - since they cant be taken for slam invitations|pg||
nt|jkdood: Since South "jumped" to 3@S, I like Mats suggestion that N bid 4@H, a lot! WD Mats|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it was really a suggestion from Barry Goren :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Besides a fine player, Barry is quite a theorist, and seems right on target here.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jkdood: 1N by E/W+90  is not a bad result, but a tie is certainly possible for last board|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s9|nt|nilsland:  4@S will probably make anyway - by the way :)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jkdood: Third seat is somewhat "anything goes", so even a non-junior is likely to choose 2@S Not Vul on the ratty suit|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nilsland:  2@S was 10-13 an 6 spades|pg||
mc|10|nt|jkdood: Even playing "standard" weak twos, 2@S is possible in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|jkdood: Somewhat a surprise that Fireman did not balance with a double at BAM NV|pg||
nt|jkdood: (or the other ratty suit 3@H? :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: Some specs think the balance was clear;  as well as 3@S by South.|pg||
nt|jkdood: So this board is very hard to predict a result WIN/LOSS/TIE|pg||
nt|jkdood: Among other uncertainities, if EW enter the auction somehow, will it be in @H or @C ?|pg||
nt|jkdood: Buying the contract in 2@S surely is "mostly favorable" to the Swedish team here|pg||
nt|jkdood: True, the phantom/compare team collected +300, but in the "real replay" that doesnt necessarily follow|pg||
nt|jkdood: If we are lucky, we will see the full teams in the linked rooms in tonites session, I understand they are working towards it|pg||
nt|jkdood: (90 minutes from now)|pg||
