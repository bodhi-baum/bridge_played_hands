nt|jkdood: The OP will maybe let us know what happened folks, I have no clue|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jkdood: Anyway WELCOME|pg||
mb|p|nt|Leo LaSota:  1C = 15+ balanced with less than 5 of either major or long clubs|pg||
nt|jkdood: IF they did NOT sit same way by accident and restart, then King has gained back 6 so far|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Leo LaSota:  1C is opened on all balanced hands 15+ w/o a major, or any normal opener with long clubs|pg||
nt|jkdood: hi|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  1 Htransfer|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Leo LaSota:  4+ spades|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  1S = 3 spades, 15-19|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jkdood: Do you agree with N not passing the opening 1@C Leo?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Leo LaSota:  absolutely|pg||
mb|p|nt|Leo LaSota:  1C is frequeently short|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  3352|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  15+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Leo LaSota:  KQxx is a clear response|pg||
nt|jkdood: Thin game was reached as a result of this action we are discussing|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  of course this does not work at all onm the layout|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  I would have passed 1S by Ruderman|pg||
nt|jkdood: @D 3-3 but dont think that will be nearly enough|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  partner has 15-19 w/ 3 spades; we have found a resting spot in our 7 card fit|pg||
nt|jkdood: AN excellent player in spec noted perhaps 1@S should have been passed|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jkdood: (as well as Leo, also an excellent player)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|Leo LaSota:  likely down 2|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jkdood: While 1@S would be a fairly easy plus|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|Leo LaSota:  Ruderman is desperate for a miracle, which he will not get on this hand.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jkdood: Stansby will surely signal in a way that suggest the spade shift|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  heart shift not terrible|pg||
nt|jkdood: Smith Echo, which tells about the "obvious shift" suit as well as opening led suit, is one tool|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  heart shift can setup the J10532 as well|pg||
nt|jkdood: My spies tell me Meckwell are in 4!N on a slight mixup|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  may be able to work an endplay for down 1; we shall see|pg||
nt|jkdood: Our hard working great coordinator Jan Martel confirms King gained 6 on first board, corrections will be shown soon|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Leo LaSota:  oh my|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  Bingo|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  huge gift|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  only defense to let it through|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  pitch spade|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Leo LaSota:  diamond diamond diamond, AKQx hearts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jkdood: I am wating for a correction, hard to believe that play|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  and Stansby must surrender King spades at the end to make; wow |pg||
nt|jkdood: Well, as Leo said, Ruderman hoping for a miracle, must be near Christmas-time!|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  this would me an absolute miracle|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  would be|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|Leo LaSota:  @@ $@@ $ |pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  game of ping pong|pg||
nt|jkdood: Yes, many specs agree Bramley's play was not ideal :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  zero play by ruderman|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  awful|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  if Bramley has the ace, he is already down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Leo LaSota:  so play for the layout that makes|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  which I would exoect looking at his hand and make|pg||
nt|jkdood: This the opportunity on SIlver Platter, wasted away.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  As much as we may question Bramley's play, Ruderman's play was not good.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h5|nt|jkdood: With Meckwell in 4NT, may still gain an imp or so, even if down|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Leo LaSota:  but double digit imps like this you cannot waste against this team|pg||
nt|jkdood: Just a strange board (35) all around, both tables!|pg||
mc|6|nt|Leo LaSota:  No way STansby skies\|pg||
nt|jkdood: Wow, so much for gaining a few imps for stopping lower!|pg||
nt|Leo LaSota:  an unfortunate "senior" moment for Ruderman there.|pg||
