pc|d8|nt|warrens:  range for opening is 10-15|pg||
nt|warrens:  to make this, I think declarer has to duck and then ruff the return with the 8 of @H's|pg||
nt|meargent: think declarer will run out of gas on the way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|warrens:  Actually, I don't think he can get home that way|pg||

nt|meargent: i doubt there is a way|pg||
nt|meargent: but then declarer play aint one of my strengths|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think the only way is double dummy, win the A and run the 7 of @H's|pg||
nt|warrens:  that way you keep entries in the dummy for ruffing out the @D's once a second round of trumps have been played|pg||
