This directory contains the LIN files that are 'bad' for some reason.

Being in this directory means that they are not processed with the other files.


The directory incorrect_nplayers contains files that have an incorrect number of players. Typically this is a player entered as, for example, "Martel, J". The comma is used as a delimiter in the player field so this team looks like it has 9 players not the usual 8. 

The directory no_players contains LIN files with no players.

The directory wrong_declarer contains LIN files that are inaccurate or incomplete. Typically one of two situations:

1) Incorrect data. For example 40630. Look at Board 10 in the closed room. This should be declared by East, by the LIN files say it was declared by West. 

In cases like this, we throw out the entire LIN file.

2) Missing boards. For example 13804. This starts at board 16, but the |rs| field is assumed to start with board 1. So we cannot match contracts with the data.
