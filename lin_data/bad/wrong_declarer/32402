nt|paulg:  okay, thanks|pg||
nt|paulg:  I'm sure Shah and Paske approve|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: They are playing the spare board now. Obviously I don't have the hand records... so a brief interlude, I'm afraid :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  So this will affect the running scores, but you can see them at http://fob.ie/sites/default/files/results-20140223_101047.php|pg||
nt|paulg:  It is all very close but you'd expect both these two teams to score heavily against Northern Ireland|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: Gormally declares 3@C on the new board 19 after Shah-Paske compete in @Ds|pg||
nt|shengabus:  On the board in view, a possible pickup here for N-S ... they escaped for only -1 in 4@h X|pg||
nt|paulg:  the matches against Scotland will be key for all three teams|pg||
nt|shengabus:  I am of course unbiased. Go Scotland!|pg||
nt|paulg:  Scotland are playing four-handed although all are very experienced players|pg||
nt|paulg:  A slight worry that they may tire a little, although I expect Shah and Paske are playing every match too|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I said yesterday, most players, young and old, overestimate their ability to play two days of bridge behind screens|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless you are professional players|pg||
