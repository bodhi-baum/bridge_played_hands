mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|uni_cicam:	there are couple of ways to should your hand after prepared 1@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_cicam:  with a non GF hand players usually bid their major first, especially if your partner has to bid 1NT with 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  finding the major fit is almost impossible if the hand is around 20/20 points|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|uni_cicam:  if NS will be in 2@H, West migh have reopend by 3@C|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  In my opinion, the best continuation after 1@C prepared are the transfers.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|uni_cicam:  it gives you a great comfort of accepting the transfer with 12-14 balanced and bidding only 1NT with 18-20 balanced|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|uni_cicam:  this way, partner can respond with a very weak hand so you can have a wider range of 1 level opening and use for example 2NT for showing such hands|pg||
