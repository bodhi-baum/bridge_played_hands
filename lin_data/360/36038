nt|ahollan1: and 2@D promises 5+@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C FG can be 2-cards|pg||
nt|ritong: so meck will make some waiting bid i guess|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think they use 2N as an asking bid/relay  just don't know the responses -- or if that is best with that @H holding|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 4@H = RKC[1430] @D|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  first step for declarer will be to avoid a @h lead|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

mb|p|nt|mrdct:  so 6@d by south is where you want to be|pg||
nt|ritong: they surely play some form of negative free bid, 2@s by north wouold be non forcing i guess|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: playing artificial 1@C and negative free bids  [where 2@S would have been non-force]  what would north 3@H bid mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i can t answer this i do not play any of this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = "semi-force"  so PASS shows balanced min|pg||
