pc|c8|nt|ritong: which is not the case of 4@s  a thing of beauty, this|pg||

nt|kit: North has the right idea -- N-S do have a game -- but it isn't 3NT|pg||
nt|jlall: well, action heating up now. Demuy hoped for 6 club tricks + a diamond + 2 hearts. He has already shown a 5332 less than 1N opener by passing so he effectively is bidding 4C but ...|pg||
nt|jlall: leaving the option of 3N open opposite the right hand|pg||
nt|ritong: on the opponents, for the next boards|pg||
mb|4D|nt|kit: But I can't see North bidding 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bebechira: they are supposed to finish in 25 mins :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 more 7-board matches remain to determine who advances to KO|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Now maybe pushed into 5@c?|pg||
nt|bebechira: not 3 ...5|pg||
nt|ritong: meck really nods approvingly about @ds|pg||
nt|bebechira: 5 more matches|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: how can Kranyak expect to make 11 tricks?  Needs a super-perfecta with nothing in spades|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|kit: I don't see what he can do but play ace and a diamond|pg||
nt|jlall: Wooldridge/Hurd bid to 5@C and Nickell guessed to bid 5@S on board 19 so it's all tied up|pg||

nt|TopWizard:  Kit, Kranyak couldn't, but . . . you never know :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|jlall: thanks all|pg||
nt|ritong: merci a tous  nice set|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  A dead tie! :)|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  So far . . . |pg||
nt|ahollan1: believe it or not     other tables still in play|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  1 hour 25 minutes|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe 1N = forcing|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: SEE|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  They recently added gazilli and changed 1NT to NF :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pbundy: oh - didn't realize that|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pbundy: seems that 5@C is on|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|TopWizard:  Thanks, Steve, innovative for our straightforward Std. American pair :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|pbundy: they needed to keep the forcing NT :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@c is magic  not sure they would find it anyway|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: they changed just to spite Peg & yours truly|pg||
nt|pbundy: i guess!|pg||
nt|pbundy: but - south will now take many tricks|pg||
mc|9|nt|TopWizard:  Virtually impossible after N opens 1@s, logic says wasted @s values 99% of the time|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  Thatts 9 trick for declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: thanks for accepting my invitation folks|pg||
nt|sbeatty:  :)|pg||
nt|ritong: hope to see you more often|pg||
nt|pbundy: thank you, henri.  on to the next match!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: back after lunch|pg||
nt|vugraphzbg: i will close the table now|pg||
