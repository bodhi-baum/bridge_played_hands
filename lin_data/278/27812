pc|hK|pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|woozle:  More imps to Denmark, from the looks of things...these six-card overcalls at the five level haven't served USA well this match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in my match Muller also bid 5@C but Ju reopened with 5@D on the way to 5@HX|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|barnets: west was not too worried about 5@HX :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|woozle:  Hurd doing as well as can be hoped, but still 11 imps away - these -200 or -300 at both tables hurts|pg||

nt|Rodal F: What is the best contract at this board? |pg||
nt|pelu:  another fine results from CR : 7 @c|pg||
nt|woozle:  7C is best...Bilde-Bilde did well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China Blue did great job preempting Tarzan Precision auction to force a guess|pg||
nt|passell: 7 clubs by far best  can make with 4-1 spades|pg||
nt|Rodal F: 7@C is the safest. Agree|pg||
