mb|2H|nt|woozle:  4S may be a sly chance to make here, but one successful defense is West giving East an eventual diamond ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|woozle:	Delmonte is playing it a bit cool with his 17-count - there are too many points at the table and he has an idea of who is short of expectation. That assumption is a little unworthy, though, since North and South are both capable of strategic|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|nt|rhelle: morning all|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|woozle:  Hanlon doubles 2c, and McGann may have to choose between inviting game and choosing a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle:  Hanlon's 3NT adds an interesting twist to the deal. This can be made with a spade guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: the general rule of responding is that partner counts on you to have 7 points|pg||
mb|d|nt|rhelle: so South, having a decent 9, invites|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|woozle:  I don't know if this is just an invitation - can he pass 3M?|pg||
