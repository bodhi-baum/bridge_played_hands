pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|woozle:  I coined a rule once - never pass out a 1NT opening with a singleton. It's an overstatement, but a good sentiment. I make an exception, however, for hands which are systemically awkward, like 4M5m or (41)44 in many methods|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Claudio has lots of tricks after that lead, looking like 9, though i'm not sure any lead would have been too helpful, N/S really needed to be playing this in 2@S|pg||
mc|9|nt|woozle:  As is often the case, the weak hand (in this case, south) is useless if its suit isn't trumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|BridgeGoth: 4@C probably a strong @D raise and cue, now they can make it to 6 for sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|woozle:  South could RKC into 7 if he knew about the fifth diamond|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|BridgeGoth: 4@H might be RKC or a cue|pg||
nt|HedyG: in Sayc or Sef N would have bid 2@d, S 4NT and over 5@s by N 7@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: 4@S could be 0/3 or a cue also :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|BridgeGoth: I'm told both cues|pg||
mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: Someone mentioned Turbo, if so 4N would be even keys|pg||
mb|5C|nt|HedyG: and 5@c asking for Q@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|HedyG: or no turbo and 4NT is rkc|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I think 4NT might have been RKC, and 5@C 0/3, |pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: then again, i'm not sure why not 7@D over 5N if that showed all keycards and Q@D|pg||
nt|woozle:  South wimps out (5NT allowed him to bid 7) probably because he doesn't know about the fifth diamond|pg||
nt|HedyG: much better for S to rkc, N cannot see the good @H suit|pg||
nt|woozle:  With better hearts (KQJxxx) south could bid 7D confidently over 5nt|pg||
nt|HedyG: in the OR N opened ...|pg||
nt|HedyG: that should get them to grand quickly|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I'd still try 7, they have to know they are behind in the match|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle:  Diamonds often get lost, even after they get opened...lots of people open phony diamonds|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|BridgeGoth: then 3@S 3N can show 5/5s|pg||

mc|13|nt|HedyG: thank you operator :)|pg||
nt|woozle:  It's not all the same though - if opener shows secondary clubs and responder prefers them to the three level, opener doesn't know as much as if he'd rebid a natural 2C and been raised|pg||
