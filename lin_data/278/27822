nt|ahollan1: if form continues in one of the 3-ways  they'll need tie-break formula there with each team leading at halftime in one match|pg||
nt|woozle:  i think that for ordinary VPed events, an extra tenth of a VP should be granted to teams for each VP they deny the opponents with a maximum win.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only 1 team advances out of the 3-way|pg||
nt|woozle:  This would reduce the number of tiebreaks and mean that there are no disincentives to win matches by more, as there are if ties are resolved by opponents' VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you probably liked scale in 60s & 70s where max win was 20 but opponent could go MINUS [up to -5]|pg||
