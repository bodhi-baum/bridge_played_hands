pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rhelle: the problem with leading the 10 for (A/K)J10 is that declarer knows it too|pg||
nt|rhelle: that surprises me too - when partner leads the K, unblock seems automatic|pg||
nt|kareno: And if you lead the jack, declarer knows you have the ten, so what's the difference?|pg||
