mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Playing 3NT as a solid minor is bad in my view|pg||
nt|fann4: 5@D could mess things up if partner has a good hand, but I think you want to shut out those majors, in case the opponents have one or both.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  now a lot of room but this time ew makes game and ns -nthing|pg||

nt|fann4: The hand is basically defenceless - that's why I'm a 5@D opener. But I guess some would prefer 1@D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bid 5@D because I don't want the opponents to get in cheaply when I am 1-1 in the majors|pg||
nt|fann4: Right|pg||
nt|saverio: i'm a 5@d opener because of double stiff in majors	  if @cs where 1 major then i'd open 1@d|pg||
