nt|kit: Now declarer might have a chance, but still difficult to get up to 10 winners|pg||
nt|kit: only 3 tricks outside of the trump suit.  Can he come up with 7 trump winners?|pg||
nt|kit: He knows spades must be 4-4.  And East must have a stiff diamond honor, else West would have shifted to a diamond.|pg||
nt|kit: But I don't see a way to take 7 trump tricks, so he will be reduced to taking the club finesse, and then won't be close.|pg||

nt|rhelle: Muller will pass this, I think - minimum 16|pg||
nt|woozle:  he does have four trumps and controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: but his trumps are very good, and so are his controls. Maybe one more try?|pg||
nt|kit: unless he falls in love with his AKJ of diamonds after the 3@D call|pg||
nt|kit: And if he does Q 5@D, now West will place the king of clubs onside and they may get there.|pg||
nt|bobholl: rob do they play 4@H as last train or real cue in this situation ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: West denies a @h control, so if East goes on, he must have one. |pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: for some reason his pd didnt bid 4@H last train, muller is thinking no doubt|pg||
nt|rhelle: sorry, I'm not sure. I missed that train a long time ago though|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: lol|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: in holland trains never run on time|pg||
nt|woozle:  I can't even construct a method which would get to grips with this pair of hands|pg||
nt|rhelle: in my younger days, I once phone my wife telling me I missed the last train from london to home by 5 hours|pg||
nt|kit: certainly not with no opposing bidding -- but here the opposing bidding might help|pg||
nt|rhelle: unsurprisingly, she was not amused :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: objectively speaking, this is not a great slam. You need to find the @sQ, and another finesse at least|pg||
nt|kit: but it gets a lot better with the enemy bidding -- and Muller knows that|pg||
nt|rhelle: bidding and makig would be a blow to NS. They already missed 2 games|pg||
nt|woozle:  finding the trumps then 1/2 finesses isn't too bad, but a heart lead will force you to commit to 1 particular finesse|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: wasnt that zia who loved to bid slams where u have to find tq?|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: anyway, a heart lead is VERY likely|pg||
nt|kit: you think South won't lead a singleton in his partner's suit?|pg||
nt|woozle:  P.Hal Sims was so good at finding queens he once diagnosed successfully that they both had it|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - South could also try his singleton though, and it's curtains for the defence straighty away|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: question of course if 3@D is natural or p/c willing to play 4@C|pg||
nt|woozle:  Odd with all of these kings to hope to catch an ace opposite|pg||
nt|kit: but the heart lead is far from safe|pg||
nt|woozle:  If we assume that Bocchi didn't mess up his system, it's diamonds|pg||
nt|kit: if it was P/C, wouldn't Madala have bid 4@C since he does have clubs?|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: of course.. but it is not a day to day situation|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: wow -- looks like they will get there now -- West's club holding must look huge on the auction.|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: anyway, it shld be pretty sure that east has a 1st rnd controlin diamonds when he goes on|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes, West can't do much else but bid 6@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle:  another big result for the Netherlands - there aren't any wrong guesses to make in the play|pg||
nt|IMP_Jan: great bid by muller (5@d), it took him some time though, not uncharacterisically|pg||
pc|d6|nt|IMP_Jan: i will suggest it as NewInBridge's bid-of-the-day|pg||
nt|woozle:  Madala takes Garozzo's famous advice, which should speed up the play|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, as specs are telling me, the NS bidding helped a lot|pg||
nt|rhelle: hoisted by their own petard, as they say|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably lead out king of spades -- for all he knows, spades is South's major|pg||
nt|woozle:  Garozzo: "always lead your singleton"|pg||
