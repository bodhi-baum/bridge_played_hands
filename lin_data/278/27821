nt|pelu:  EW overbord in CR - after 1@H in 4. pos - they just bid on - and bid on - and bid on :):) - but no double|pg||
nt|woozle:  Duboin's opening on the filthy west cards has propelled EW into the same dreadful game as the other room|pg||
pc|d5|nt|woozle:  Dennis would have done better to bid 1H then 2H, (or open 2H, in 4th seat) to limit his hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nobody said Sementa had to game force with his collection|pg||

nt|woozle:  Sementa sets himself a diamond trick so is already a trick ahead of Bilde|pg||
nt|pelu:  now "only" down 3 - in CR Dennis played @dQ in trick 1 |pg||

pc|sJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pelu:  and then @H to dummy and @c to K and A - so he just setup a lot of tricks for defense|pg||

mb|4D|nt|smoller:  Interesting - EW have few poits but many tricks|pg||
nt|woozle:  North overcalls 1H with neither a hand nor a suit, but will survive as he catches a big double fit|pg||
nt|woozle:  I hope for EW's sake that 4D is clearly defined here as a splinter|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|woozle:  Apparently not, but at least Dennis didn't pass it|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle:  If EW reach 6S here, they'll have to guess spades very deftly|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|woozle:  6C is actually a better slam than 6S, since you might be able to buy some time before guessing spades|pg||
nt|woozle:  South's singleton club makes a successful spade guess more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller:  a spectators suggests thar 5@D could be anti-splinter suggest no waste i diamonds|pg||
nt|woozle:  Not much of a hand though|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|smoller:  agreed, but 2 prime cards|pg||
nt|woozle:  I think that west was inferring an interpretation of 4D and East wasn't sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|tokay1975: ns didnot bid too much  .  to guess spades is not easy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|woozle:  Note, by the way, that with all of this excitement in the EW auction we've overlooked Madala. Apparently, he's seen Bocchi's overcalls before, and could tell from the table vibe that the auction was no longer about him and his hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|tokay1975: other table playing 6h number 12  no chance|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s5|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|smoller:  North has more hearts than South - that is all he knows|pg||
nt|woozle:  Good lead from Bocchi, who inferred from 4D that a heart was more likely to cash|pg||

mb|1D|nt|pelu:  6@s on @sQ|pg||
nt|woozle:  These young whippersnappers are committed to opening light|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: Duboin NOT a disciple of Steve Robinson|pg||
mb|2S|nt|woozle:  6C is better, because you can try to get some information (like the club break) before trying to guess spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "if you don't open a 5-card Majors --- you don't have one"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|woozle:  Is it just me, or does Sementa's first pass look odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: getting tougher to find those 9-card @H fits|pg||
mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|woozle:  With all this EW excitement, we've overlooked Auken's interesting 1D overcall, showing where her stuff is instead of her length|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: i can't tell  IF he declares   is auction going to help Duboin find @SQ|pg||
nt|woozle:  I'm told that East had no choice but pass in his system. Seems like a big systemic defect to me.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|woozle:  Welland will need to hold his tongue at high levels here, lest he lose his SQ|pg||
nt|pelu:  will Ns bidding give Duboin the winning play in a 6@s contract - if they bis that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|woozle:  EW stop in 5S, which will lack excitement in the play. 13 imps to Italy, now developing a commanding lead|pg||

nt|woozle:  Indeed, it did not. But I think 6C would have made, and M Bilde had a chance to pass it|pg||
