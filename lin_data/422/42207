nt|ritong: 2@s is forced imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ritong: opener denied 4 cards in @s, so 2@s is the practical game forcing bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|reisig: Whatever they reach -- better get @ds right|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: 7@d seems best|pg||
nt|ritong: 7NT is, no?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Cayne trying to also bid 5@C in response to what he thought was RKCB   Meck pointing out that 5@C is insuffcient|pg||
nt|reisig: Hate a @c out ve 7N|pg||
nt|ritong: depends who declares|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Bd is flipped NS so what shows here as Cayne is really Seamon and vice versa|pg||
nt|ritong: no one would lead the stiff @c K|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|Vugraphzfe: and Rodwell led|pg||
