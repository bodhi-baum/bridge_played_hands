mb|7S|mb|p|nt|kit: The play in 7 will be very interesing -- declarer would have to guess which minor-suit finess to take|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|brgpro: yes|pg||

nt|kit: And West will pitch down to stiff king of clubs eventually|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer will probably have count on the hand, and will play for squeeze knowing West started with 4 clubs|pg||
nt|brgpro: he might also choose to cash @sA, then play 3 rounds of @d, (if @s are not 3-0)|pg||
nt|kit: If spades were 2-1 he could set up diamonds and use 8 of spades entry -- but not with spades 3-0|pg||
nt|brgpro: @s8 is the entry for the long @d if 3-3 if not then take @c finesse|pg||

nt|brgpro: did he really discard a @c from dummy?|pg||
