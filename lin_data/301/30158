mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|danilo1: very good score for Kniga in Closed Room ... 5@D may be down (not to talk about 6@D), and 4@H not easy to bid|pg||

pc|s4|pc|cT|mc|7|nt|granguru:  normally defense loses a tempo as partner is blocked or cant return thesuit later|pg||
nt|jkdood: There was no overcall in other room; here, West might find his partner with something (like AK) in spades|pg||
nt|granguru:  different thing is paradoxically when the leader has 5 cards|pg||
nt|danilo1: think 3NT (too fast) ... and @C void are voting for try in @S surprise|pg||

mc|7|nt|jkdood: The clubs were guessed in the other room, for 4S to make and a pickup.|pg||
nt|danilo1: to note that immediate 4 rounds of @C is not enough - instead overruffing, declarer would discard @HJ ... therefore South had to play @H and not third @C ...|pg||

nt|granguru:  4th suit|pg||
nt|jkdood: 6D is probably a wee bit better than 50%, but unless there is a helpful opening lead, has no hope.|pg||
nt|danilo1: East should drive to 6@D ... good contract (@C 3-3 or @SA well placed) ,,, unlucky lay.out, but may get lucky lead|pg||
