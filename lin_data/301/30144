nt|bobh1: start off with a grand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|louisg: fun hand to start, good grand hearts, spades or NT|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|louisg: He found it!|pg||
nt|shuster:  nothing like an easy hand to start the match with|pg||
nt|bobh1: this grand requires 32 @Ss|pg||
nt|shuster:  7S will do.  7NT is much better|pg||
nt|louisg: or 7H, but in this case they all make|pg||
nt|louisg: Marty couldn't be sure that Rick has a second heart, without which 7S may be best.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|shuster:  perhaps 2H over 2D would have clarified that|pg||
pc|d2|nt|louisg: That would show 3 cards for most I believe|pg||
nt|japfel:  7H is better slam, as a spade loser is unavoidable|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jkdood: A lot of wasted duplications in diamonds, but still 14 top tricks!|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|guymath:  stayman auctions will get everyone to spades|pg||
nt|guru:  might jump to 7H after some blackwooding to offer choice|pg||
nt|guymath:  ihe would have to ask for kings to find out about the heart king|pg||
nt|guymath:  i thin 3H by Arnie in this auction was a stron raise in spades|pg||
nt|guymath:  with shortness|pg||
nt|guru:  Yes, the 6 hearts were incidental.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|guymath:  3N by N would have asked so I assum 4C is a very stron Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|guymath:  Arnie will now ask for specific kings|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|guymath:	and then he will have the chance to bid 7H over 6H as a coice|pg||
nt|guru:  and after 6 hearts, he might be 7H to offer choice|pg||
nt|guru:  Stop typing faster than me!|pg||

nt|guymath:  key cards|pg||

nt|shuster:  at least all grands make, so no one will get punished for a huge number of imps by a random break|pg||
nt|japfel:  Rowland is pretty aggresive. I wonder if he will show his spade suit after East opens and West responds|pg||
mb|1C|nt|shuster:  most people would bid 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|louisg: I'm guessing that he will|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  I guess they can hold him to 5 tricks there|pg||
nt|shuster:  4|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jkdood: If I recall, The Civales do not play support doubles, which adds a wrinkle|pg||
mb|p|nt|japfel:  A support double would have made the E/W auction easier|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bobh1: W could have doubled|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|louisg: A double by Pat might have gotten 800, but hard to catch them at the one leve|pg||
nt|louisg: level|pg||
nt|bobh1: agree|pg||
pc|sA|nt|shuster:  pretty unlucky to be going for 800 at the 1-level with 100 honors in your suit|pg||
nt|japfel:  A club lead by North makes declarer's job harder, but the spade lead sinks the defense|pg||
nt|louisg: yes that's what makes the overcall pretty safe even vul.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shuster:  i assume he'll try to uppercut on the third round of spades, and will be disappointed that the best south can produce is the 7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|louisg: This will now be 11 quick tricks, using a spade to pitch a club loser|pg||
nt|japfel:  Should make 11 tricks. Duck third spade, ruff in hand, ruff a diamond in dummy, draw trumps|pg||
nt|japfel:  Wins six hearts, two clubs, two diamonds and one spade|pg||
nt|jkdood: The spade overcall could make West at least ponder a 4-1 heart break for the play|pg||
nt|shuster:  you wouldn't take a diamond ruff before drawing a second trump?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|japfel:	Ok to draw one trump before ruffing a diamond|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||
nt|shuster:  i guess then you might not be able to pick of 4-1 onside, but you could always ruff another spade yourself to obviate the finesse|pg||

nt|jkdood: they did|pg||
nt|guymath:  they may play 2C as a simple raise that is what Ken Cohen prefers|pg||
nt|guymath:  I can't imagine stretching this crappy 9 count to an inverted minor|pg||
nt|jkdood: They actually wrong-sided it with a spade lead, but the entryless East saved the day|pg||

nt|shuster:  sort of.  Either opponent could have four spades, and now their doubles are penalty|pg||
nt|jkdood: err, foolish|pg||
nt|louisg: not having overcalled could pay dividends here|pg||

nt|louisg: :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: North having no minor suit aces seems to suggest a low road, but the high road prospers tonite|pg||
nt|shuster:  KQx, AQJx, KQxx, xx in North is also a max and you have the right number of key cards then, even the trump queen|pg||
nt|japfel:  Barring a ruff, slam is a bit over 50%. Spades 2-2 (42%) or Queen singleton (12%) or 4-0 onside (5%)|pg||
nt|louisg: given that south didn't splinter, looks like all of north's cards figure to be working and he has a max|pg||

nt|jkdood: There is however possibility of a Civale dessert delay....|pg||
nt|louisg: I know that i'd still be recovering from dinner.|pg||
nt|jkdood: The other room commented that due to Ken Cohen infuences, the 1C-2c(by passed hand) earlier, was a simple raise, not inverted.|pg||
nt|louisg: For those who don't know, this is a 28 board match to determine the winner of the Solomon trophy, the annual Philadephia-area team competition.|pg||
nt|jkdood: (Also: Marty and Rick play on teams with Ken for those who might not know)|pg||
nt|jkdood: They are in Chesterfield NJ, at the Civale home|pg||
nt|louisg: I know lots of people playing inverted minors off by a passed hand, theory is that inverted raises are most important for slams and clhoice of game bidding which is less relevant|pg||
nt|jkdood: It a very good thing to discuss; Ive seen (and had) a few accidents over the years for that.|pg||
nt|louisg: I would think that if inverted raises are agreed then they would be on by PH unless explicitly discussed otherwise.|pg||
nt|louisg: Others may not agree however.|pg||
nt|jkdood: In the other room Arnie Fisher (who has won a few championships) actually choose 1NT, not clubs at all:)|pg||
nt|louisg: certainly reasonable with Qxx in both majors.|pg||
nt|jkdood: Due to the interesting (but safe due to Easts lack of entry) spade position, he actually right-sided 3nt|pg||
nt|louisg: and it's no secret that Arnie likes to declare :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: :)|pg||
nt|jkdood: For anyone just joining, the second half (14 boards of this final) will begin in a few minutes, after break.|pg||
nt|louisg: Can we get any indication from the operator how close we are to resuming?|pg||
nt|louisg: I need to take a short break.....|pg||
nt|jkdood: I suspect the pairs may re-seat differently for the second half|pg||
nt|jkdood: At least the operator has penciled a change in, so perhaps we are about to get under way, with a different N/S here|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
