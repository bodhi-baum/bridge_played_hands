nt|rv: yes very tough to organize any bridge tournament in current scenario|pg||
nt|psridhar: meanwhile an opportunity for the trailing team here|pg||
nt|rv: AGSAR qualified for SFs w/o winning single match in their QFs Round Robin which also included Texans, Jalan and Aristos|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: the @s game needs 3-3 in trumps on @d lead|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|rv: AGSAR played steady bridge, drew with Texans and lost narrowly to both Aristos and Jalan, but Texans did them favor by beating Aristos and Jalan comprehensively|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: good stop by Manas-Subir, Manas took the low road and it paid off|pg||
nt|psridhar: the deficit is poised to reduce by 12 here-tightening the match|pg||
nt|vugraphzcx: texan aces and agsar  tied their match during QF round robin|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: that 2@s was conservative, i wd hv either tried 2@d or 3@s|pg||
nt|rv: if @CJ was @SJ, I might have bid 3@s, I agree with Manas's 2@shere|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|psridhar: if N opens 1N he will swiftly be in 3N here|pg||
nt|rv: we could have another swing if N-S reach 3n and if East leads a low @h|pg||
nt|psridhar: i am not advocating it but many modern experts upgarde 14 hcp hands freely these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|rv: Manas's hand doesn't have any intermediates and no reason to upgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: last set in my match both N opened 14 hcp 1N on both vul and defedners lost their game 5@s making|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: no intermediates and no 5 card suit, 1@c opening is clearly right|pg||

pc|h9|nt|ianco: north in keeping wit his conservative approach|pg||
nt|rv: I will consider rebid of 3@s with Subirda's hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: passing 2@s is an extreme position to take at IMPs-is he trying for aa swing inspired by the earlier 2@s ?|pg||

nt|rv: based on brds and results from other room, it doesn't look very likely that Bangur can overcome this deficit|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|rv: responsive double by Prajwal here?|pg||

nt|psridhar: prajwal may close 3nt but his @d are thin|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rv: Prajwal has shown 1 key, but hasn't shown his @c void|pg||
