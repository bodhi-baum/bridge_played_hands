nt|benjent:  Hi everybody|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: N/S play their famous Fantunes system, I'll explain all their bids as needed,, E/W play a very natural system|pg||
nt|tricks2011: Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent:  System cards are available at http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=BermudaBowl&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CWBC2013|pg||
mb|1S|nt|BridgeGoth: Tough hand to start, 1@S or 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tricks2011: i like 1@S myself but one prays that this is not the hand where I make 4:)|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|1N|nt|benjent:  Easy for Fantoni-Nunes - they open 1@s forcing|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Yes, and West a rare hand they would respond 1NT with support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent:  Typically gutsy balancing X by Fantoni|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Yes, no surprise, he came to play.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent:  Well, on this hand, he came to be dummy :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|BridgeGoth: looks like he can score 4@D, Q@S and A@C, i don't see much poential for anything else|pg||

pc|s3|pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|cT|pg||
nt|tricks2011: there is a possiblity of a 7th either in hearts or a club--possible endplay on east for 7..|pg||
nt|benjent:  Right now, he's just trying to get a count to decide how to play the @d suit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tricks2011: true|pg||
mc|6|nt|BridgeGoth: E assures down 1... after the K@C exit should be known whats going on|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: E would not have opened 1@S with 23, so he can place everything|pg||
nt|benjent:  Having seen 2 @c pitches from Nunes, there was probably no danger in exiting @cK, but simplifying simple defences is usually a good plan|pg||
nt|tricks2011: yep, your partner always appreciates it:)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Well Monaco scores 2 to start, 1@S passed out at the other table for 110|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: Fantoni probably going to bid 4@C as a serious slam try, He has too much to quit in my opinion|pg||
mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: Nunes will cue 4@H, denying a @D control and then 4@S will end the auction|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|BridgeGoth: N/S play Italian cuebids, so if they skip a suit, they have NO control|pg||
mb|p|nt|tricks2011: the question is will they stop in time?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|BridgeGoth: 1@S, almost comical unless you know their systme|pg||
mb|d|nt|benjent:  7@s if you've got your bidding boots on|pg||
mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: Double there is general values, 2NT as a natural invite is not availible|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tricks2011: that double might assist those efforts--negative I assume?|pg||
nt|benjent:  3@s is effectively setting suit|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: if Fantoni cues 4@D, they'll be off to the races|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|BridgeGoth: 4NT = even   of keycards|pg||
mb|p|nt|tricks2011: Setting up a forcing auction--showing even number of keys?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|BridgeGoth: Fantoni now forced to bid on since he has the missing keycard|pg||
nt|benjent:  Still off to the races. And the opera :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: He is assuming 4NT = 4, so 5@D shows the K@D and the A@H|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: or some sort of forward going action|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: 5NT = no Q@S, have all keycards|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: NOW A@H and K@D confirmed|pg||
nt|tricks2011: also, doesn't 5@D deny club control?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|BridgeGoth: yes 5@D denies @C control|pg||
nt|benjent:  Nunes doesn't need much more here ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: 6@C shows Q@S, seeing if he has ANYTHING else to offer|pg||
nt|benjent:  @dq would be the perfect card|pg||
mb|6S|nt|tricks2011: or K of H|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 6@S essentially nothing else to say|pg||
nt|benjent:  I think with @hAK and @dK he would have cued earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|BridgeGoth: In 7 he probably goes down. I think the best line is AK@D to try for Qx followed by @C finesse,|pg||
nt|tricks2011: u are right..|pg||
nt|benjent:  Fantoni knows that @hA is not an entry, so the prospect of setting up his @d's is not as attractive as it might normally be|pg||
nt|tricks2011: ben..|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Someone asked what he would bid with the Q@S: 5N showed all keycards and no Q@S, 5@S would have shown no Q@S and 1 keycard missing|pg||
nt|benjent:  With the overcall, he might have pursued a squeeze line instead|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: bidding past 5NT = have all keycards + Q@S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|BridgeGoth: if @S were 2-1, the 8@S would have worked as an entry :)|pg||

pc|sT|nt|benjent:  Ok, you guys can take the same side. Any kibs want to take the bet? :)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: A kib just mentioned he can cash the A@C as a Vienna coup|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: Worse yet, he's marked the location of the A@D, now the line is also clear|pg||
nt|tricks2011: off 5 for 1100..|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: 7@C would depend on the lead, cross ruffing availible, |pg||
nt|benjent:  Bosenberg will think about @h 4-0, but I reckon he'll figure the layout is something like this|pg||
nt|tricks2011: that is true..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|BridgeGoth: In a 22 point slam it's tough to judge the X, i'd think he'll read it as a power X, and not a trump stack|pg||
nt|benjent:  Excuse me, Eber, not Bosenberg|pg||
nt|benjent:  Awks for Fantoni. He doesn't want to beat air, but this is looking pretty bad for him.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: He knows he's in big trouble looking at the board. I think his only way to beat is hop with the A@D and give a @C ruff, but surely Eber wouldn't be that careless if that was ...|pg||

nt|BridgeGoth: Fantunes can have any 5422 except both majors, or any 4441 if in range|pg||

nt|tricks2011: well done by fantoni|pg||
mc|9|nt|tricks2011: eber has had a rough go of it on the defensive end during this match..|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Well while they fix the power... Ben and I can entertain the crowd with Fantunes discussion!|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: So Ben, you're a kickback guy, ever tried their method of slam bidding? (turbo)|pg||
nt|benjent:  I have tried it. It works fine, but when we saw F-N would occasionally have an "off by 2" accident, and decided to stick with keycard. Which works fine too :)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Joe and I use Turbo and have found it very effective, the advantage of course being the ability to cuebid and show   of keycards in the same bid|pg||
nt|benjent:  Sure. One of the great things Fantoni & Nunes have done for the bridge world is to remind us that there is more than 2 ways to bid naturally (ie it's more than the choice between 4-5 cards majors and weak-strong 1NT)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: Yes, what many do not realize is that Fantunes is NOT an artificial system, it is very natural, especially the way Ben and his partner Bill Jacobs play it.|pg||
nt|benjent:  When we first started playing Fantunes, people looked at us suspiciously like we were playing some crazy aggressive system. The reality is that we play much sounder opening bids than everybody else (at the 1 AND 2 levels)|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I agree with this, it's very sound, and people aren't sure what do think of it.|pg||
nt|benjent:  I think there are 2 reasons the 2's are so effective|pg||
nt|benjent:  1 - they're actually quite tightly defined, so you get preemption without losing your ability to bid constructuvely (unlike the very wide range weak things people play)|pg||
nt|benjent:  2 - when you have one, on average it's actually your hand, which actually makes it more dangerous than people realise to overcall|pg||
nt|dbl me:  Opponents can sometimes assume they're being stolen from...they need to remember the 2-bids are not preempts.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: I'm going add a 3rd one to that , If you have a fit, you can blow the opponents right out of the auction when it is their hand also|pg||
nt|benjent:  Right - you get a pre-emptive effect because you're opening at the 2 level, but you have a real hand|pg||
nt|dbl me:  ...and even when you overshoot, it is difficult for one opp to x and the other to pass.|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: The downside of the 2s is when responder has a strong suit of his own, very hard to play in another suit some times.|pg||
nt|benjent:  Right, but when the oppos overshoot, you can wield the axe pretty effectively|pg||
nt|dbl me:  also true|pg||
nt|benjent:  One handling your own strong suit - yeah, you need some tools to get those hands out.|pg||
nt|benjent:  So for example, after 2M openings, we play transfers!|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: One example would be: x xx AKJx AKQJxx after a 2@S opening, I dont like the prospects of bidding 3@H(@C) or 2N(relay) when i might be facing 6 or 7 card @S suit|pg||
nt|benjent:  We try very hard not to have a 7 card suit when we open 2 bananas, because it does get hard to handle|pg||
nt|BridgeGoth: As do I, but sometimes its unavoidable|pg||
nt|benjent:  Sorry we don't have a hand to talk about folks - the power has gone down in the main server room, so the operators can't get the "next" hand from the server|pg||
nt|benjent:  Spoke just a moment too soon/late :)|pg||
