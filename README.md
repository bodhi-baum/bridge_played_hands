# bridge_played_hands
Data containing played hands from various Bridge (the card game) tournaments.

The goal is to have a collection of played hands, including hand records, with bidding and play if possible, in a centralized location.

Given this data, it is then possible to perform analysis on the data, such as, how good is a declarer, how good are a pair at defending or opening leads. Detailed analysis of hands could be used to find patterns of cheating.

I have tried to keep this README file small, there are various sub topics in separate files.

## LIN files

See the separate file [LIN.md](LIN.md) in this directory for details on LIN files.
Some notes on the LIN files and pecularities are in [LIN_NOTES.md](LIN_NOTES.md).

## Other files

At the moment, only LIN files from Vugraph are included.
If you have access to other records, which include hand records, bidding, play of the hand, let me know.

## Statistics

See the separate file [STATISTICS.md](STATISTICS.md) for information on the various statistics that are collected.

## Process

See the separate file [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) for information on how the data is collected and processed.

## Criticisms

There are some concerns and known criticisms of a statistial based approach to catch cheating.
These are addressed in a separate file [CRITICISMS.md](CRITICISMS.md).

## Background

Some background information is in a separate file [BACKGROUND.md](BACKGROUND.md).

## TODO

This is a list of volunteer TODO items to complete the work.
If you have some time to assist the project, please look at 
[TODO.md](TODO.md).

## Status

In the short term I will track the status of this project in a separate
file [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## Detecting Cheating

Some information on detecting cheating is in a separate file [DETECTING_CHEATING.md](DETECTING_CHEATING.md).
