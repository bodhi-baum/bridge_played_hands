# bridge_played_hands
Data containing played hands from various Bridge (the card game) tournaments.

The goal is to have a collection of played hands, including hand records, with bidding and play if possible, in a centralized location.

Given this data, it is then possible to perform analysis on the data, such as, how good is a declarer, how good are a pair at defending or opening leads. Detailed analysis of hands could be used to find patterns of cheating.
