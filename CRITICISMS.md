## Criticisms

There are potential criticisms to this approach so it is important to address these concerns.

### Accuracy

Statistics are only as good as the data. Garbage In, Garbage Out.

There may be mistakes in the LIN files. VuGraph operators may miss spots or enter wrong cards.

We assume that the same error rate applies to all players and can be statistically ignored.
This is a broad statement.

Obviously if there are any known errors in the data, these need to be corrected.
There are mechanisms in place to make sure that this can happen.

### Double Dummy Analysis (DDA)

Double dummy analysis should not be applied to a single dummy game.

This is true, but we are using statistics to guage player strengths, weaknesses and detect cheating. One hand rarely proves anything, a consistent set of results indicates a pattern.

### Quality of compared data

The LIN files contain hands varying from practice games to Juniors to Seniors to National and higher.

Arguably practice games should be excluded from all statistical analysis.

Although comparing against all data can be useful, if we are looking for cheating allegations, then the comparison set should only include similar type of events.
