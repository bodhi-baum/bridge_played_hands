## LIN NOTES

Just putting this somewhere as the information may be useful to others.

1. The player information is usually after 'pn' but sometimes is after 'pw'.

2. The title is after 'vg'

3. The number of tricks taken/claimed 'mc' is sometimes missing. This information is, however, in the 'rs' field.
